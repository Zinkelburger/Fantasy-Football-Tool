Not a bad late round option…just not that excited about Saints offense in general.

Shaheed is absolutely that guy I’ll draft late, never want to cut him so he’ll take up a bench spot most of the year, but I’ll never have the guts to start him even on a bad bye week.

He's a good pick in dynasty too, because he may be in a different situation after this year. He has so much potential that can be unlocked in the right system.

You need Shaheed so he can drop 25 pts on your bench and 6 pts the few times you start him.

Good dart throw
