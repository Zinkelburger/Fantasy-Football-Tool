Potential Upside:

Davante Adams, now reunited with offensive coordinator Luke Getsy, brings a promising outlook for the 2024 fantasy football season. Getsy and Adams have a successful history together from their time with the Green Bay Packers, where Adams had some of his best seasons. Getsy's familiarity with Adams' strengths could lead to more optimized routes and target opportunities, potentially enhancing Adams' already elite production. Adams remains one of the top wide receivers in the league, known for his precise route running and ability to make big plays.
Potential Drawbacks:

However, there are some concerns to keep in mind. The overall performance of the Raiders' offense, led by Jimmy Garoppolo, might impact Adams' fantasy output. Garoppolo's performance has been inconsistent, which could affect Adams' target quality and volume. Additionally, the Raiders' offensive line and the effectiveness of the running game can influence the passing game's success. Furthermore, at age 31, there may be slight concerns about the beginning of a decline or injury risk, although Adams has been relatively durable throughout his career.

"I think the Raiders will be very competitive this year. I like Adams to put up big numbers again, despite the unsettled QB situation at the moment.

They upgraded their D significantly. They added another stud TE to their offense, which will take the focus away from DA a bit more.

And most of all, the players believe in their coach and are going to play hard for him.

They may lose a bunch of close games and the record might not show it. But I see them being a very competitive team and if thatâ€™s the case, Adams is going to do his thing."

"Yep. Arguably the most talented WR in the league. Will score under 10 pts when you need him most. Not his fault."
