As a Jets fan yes that's why they drafted him. Don't expect much in fantasy this year though. 500 yards tops. 
We won't throw much and he's like the 5th option at best after Wilson, Hall, Williams, and Conklin. 

Completely agree. He may earn the starting role but not really sure that it will be worth much at all in this offense.
I don't have much interest at all in this offense outside of Hall and Wilson. Williams is a god awful pick at his ADP of 100 in my opinion
