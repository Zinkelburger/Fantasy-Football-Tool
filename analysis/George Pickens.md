"I get that the Steelers likely won’t be a pass-first team under Smith, but they weren’t a pass heavy team last year either. Now Pickens loses his best competition for targets and gets an upgrade at QB. Everything points towards an improvement, plus he’s a 3rd year player, yet he’s going behind his overall fantasy finish from last year.

I think Pickens is a great value this year where he’s being drafted."

"Absolutely, I don’t expect the Steelers to be a pass heavy team at all. That doesn’t mean he can’t have a great season though and be a very good value. I have a hard time seeing him bust at WR28 ADP."

"Let's just ignore the fact that George Pickens, when Diontae Johnson wasn't in the lineup, had Target Shares all above 22.0%."

"George Pickens - The vibes in Pittsburgh aren't great behind center and I can see this situation blowing up. That said, there's no real competition and he has the talent to take a big leap. I love Pickens as a ceiling play and bank on established role for floor."

"I think both of these articles are what sold me on fading Pickens (you can control + f his last name and Arthur Smith to find the specifics). The Steelers will have a very run heavy approach with Smith at OC. And Wilson and Fields led offenses that had catchable target rates near the bottom of the league last year; along with the Falcons having one of the lowest catchable target rates over the last two seasons (which can certainly be a fault of both coaching and QB play)."

"Russ and Fields aren’t elite but they do both have one strength - they love throwing it deep. I think they’re a great fit for giving Pickens a nice season and I like him at current cost. "

"I have an addiction to George Pickens, which is real annoying as I'm not even a Steelers fan.

As a low end WR2 you can't do much better. If you're hoping for the ceiling then you better hope Fields takes over and learns how to read deep cover defense. I'm fully on the Pickens train personally.

Since posting this I've listened to the Ringer Fantasy Football pod and I'm back on. If Russ turned Courtland Sutton into a TD monster then he can do the same to Pickens"

Pickens had 1200 with Pickett last year, with a significant upgrade at QB [now is Russell Wilson]
