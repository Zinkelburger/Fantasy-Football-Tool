"Because over the last four years Allen has finished QB1, QB1, QB2, QB1. 

He’s also broken 400 points four years in a row, which hurts hasn’t done once."

"Allen is a significantly better passer and QB overall. He put up insane numbers last season with Diggs on the decline, Davis basically just running windsprints, and no true alpha receiver. He doesn't need those things to produce QB1 numbers."

"Net, we know Allen can deliver QB1 numbers in his current setup. Diggs and Davis are not major losses. Conversely there is a huge amount of uncertainty around Hurts and the new offense, regardless of skill player talent."

"Also, Allen will have a full season of Joe Brady at OC, rather than being hamstrung by Ken Dorsey’s bullshit for half the year. While Allen isn’t likely to rush for 15 TDs again, his history speaks for itself."

Potential Upside:

    Offensive Creativity: Brady's schemes are designed to exploit defensive weaknesses, which should result in more dynamic and high-scoring games for Allen.
    Improved Decision Making: Allen showed better field vision and decision-making under Brady, reducing critical mistakes and turnovers​ (Sporting News)​.
    Enhanced Rushing Attack: The Bills' balanced offensive approach, including a stronger rushing attack, should alleviate some pressure off Allen, allowing for more efficient passing opportunities​ (NFL Analysis Network)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:

    Turnover Concerns: Allen's turnover issues in 2023 (18 interceptions) are a point of concern. Ensuring these are minimized will be crucial for maintaining high fantasy value​ (NFL Analysis Network)​.
    Personnel Changes: The departure of key receiver Stefon Diggs might impact the passing game, requiring younger receivers and tight ends to step up​ (NFL Analysis Network)​.
    Consistency: Maintaining the late-season performance into a full season will be essential. Brady's continued adaptation and strategic flexibility will be tested​ (NBC Sports)​.
