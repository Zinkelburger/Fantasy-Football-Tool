"You have got to believe in Andy Reid and Pat Mahomes.  If you do, then this offense should see a bounce back this season, and Pacheco doesn't have a lot of competition in a role that should give him plenty of touchdown opportunities.  The Chiefs only brought back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, which implies they trust Pacheco to carry the workload.  If he becomes the bell-cow of an elite offense, he could improve on last year's Top 15 RB Performance.  Reid will get creative in making Pacheco effective, while Mahomes should likely get him more involved in the passing game with Jerick McKinnon gone.  Pacheco should be a stud with a great opportunity."

Isiah Pacheco (A good player in a good offense without much competition behind him)

Dude is on one of the best offenses in football, completely controls the workload, and can catch passes. He has RB1 upside.

He may have the upside, but I feel like KC doesn't really produce RB1's. This is just a feeling analysis more than anything. Or maybe I'm still burned from drafting CEH in the first round his rookie year. This might be CEH bias. Before him any back who got touches in KC was instantly an RB2 or better. That (plus the high draft pick) was one of the reasons people were so hyped for CEH and subsequently so let down. 

He really isnâ€™t a great player, just a great situation. He doesnâ€™t have the size to break tackles or the vision to avoid a lot of them. And he isnâ€™t a good receiver. Thatâ€™s just my eye test talking but I bet there are stats to back that up
Your eyes donâ€™t work. The chiefs running game improved significantly when they replaced CEH with Pacheco. Only agree with your receiver take.

Pacheco was a 7th round rookie who might as well have gone UDFA, the fact he overtook CEH out of nowhere, and the Chiefsâ€™ backfield splits through the last 3 years, and why itâ€™s all BAD for Pacheco coming into this year lol!
Iâ€™ve had Pacheco for two years, two HUGE years and Iâ€™ll love him for it, but now itâ€™s time to put that Konami code to rest now that everyone wants to play when itâ€™s not cool anymore ðŸ˜Ž
