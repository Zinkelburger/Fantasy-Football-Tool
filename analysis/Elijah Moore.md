I think when they ran with the 2WR sets in the pre-season game, take that how ever you want, it was Moore and Allen out there. Does feel like at least Moore is WR1 on the team and I think going around the right ADP.

"His 6.2 yards per target ranked 88th, indicating inefficiency in his opportunities. Limited Upside: While Moore had a couple of games with 15.4 and 17.1 fantasy points, his overall inconsistency and lack of significant production make it hard to trust him moving forward"

Role in the Offense: Moore is expected to be the third or fourth target behind Cooper, Jeudy, and potentially tight end David Njoku. This limits his upside.
