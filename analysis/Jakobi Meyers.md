"Meyers has been a consistent 100+ target earner other than Davante in this horrendous offense. White and Bowers will have learning struggles and whether it’s Minshew or O’Connell Meyers is destined to find some consistency in his target share and has capability of TD upside due to him capitalizing on Adams being a major threat in the Red Zone. Plus Adams has gone on record with Shannon Sharpe praising Meyers for picking up on his advice. Those two are the lone high volume/high skilled options I’d take from what looks to be a horrendous Raiders offense."
