-But the hate for Justin Herbert in 2024 has gone too far. In early rankings, I’ve seen Justin Herbert ranked as low as the QB16 overall, behind rookies Caleb Williams and Jayden Daniels and that’s too low. 

-I’m lower on Justin Herbert next season than I ever have been but if I can get him in the double digit rounds, he will be on a lot of my teams in 2024 

For me it’s not Herbert it’s that he has no bonafied weapons. Teams in a rebuild, so it’s hard for me to invest in him.

No weapons and a head coach and OC who want to dominate the running game.

Harbaugh wants to ground and pound you into submission, it's probably better for the team, but it's going to drop Herbert's fantasy output.

I think he’s going to be a great irl qb next year but he’s completely off my board in 1 qb leagues, and would have to be great value for 2 qb.

Yeah, im just not taking a qb who lost his RB1, WR1, and WR2 and is in the first year of a notoriously run first and second OC.
