The Case for Calvin Ridley to Be a WR1. An annual analysis of WRs drafted outside top 30. 
 In 2024 The Main candidate is Calvin Ridley. The secondary candidate is Diontae Johnson but considering his injury just now I’ll go into Ridley.

Ridley meets all the criteria. Best WR FINISH WR4 2020. New QB and system. Has an ambiguous battle for WR1 within his team.

I believe he’s getting significantly undervalued here.

The Titans invested heavily in their Oline this offseason. They brought in Pollard instead of Henry they hired in Callahan who worked in a pass first happy offense. Ridley had an insane 129 yards and 8 DPI’s drawn by him which show that he was getting open it just wasn’t working out for him. 4 of these were IN THE ENDZONE This could lead to just half those yards and TDS it moves him up a decent amount.

TL:DR I’m not saying Ridley is a must slam. I’m simply making the case that he’s a player being drafted outside the top 30WRs who could be a WR1.

After the Hopkins injury I’m much higher on Ridley. Even if Hopkins is back for week 1, a knee injury at his age could have impacts through the first half of the season.
The worry is that the Titans use him mainly as a field stretcher at the X. If they get more creative and move him around and get him some easier looks in space it could be good.
When Burrow went down last year Callahan used a lot of short check downs to keep Browning comfortable. Browning was 20th (among 35 QBs to throw 200+ passes) in air yards per attempt. There’s a lot of talk about getting Levis’ completion percentage up with a similar strategy, and he has the two receiving backs to make that possible. If Ridley is used similar to how Chase was once Browning came in that’ll be worrying.
That being said, Levis wants to push the ball down field (5th out of 35 passers in air yards per attempt), and even if there is an emphasis on getting him easy completions, Levis’ tendencies to throw down field won’t (or maybe can’t) be entirely curtailed.

Don’t raise his ADP, he’s my favorite pick and is a complete steal for where he’s going.
Ridley had sooooo many good catches/touchdowns dropped and he finished WR17, Jaguars didn’t even use him properly either. Titans spent a bag to get him, the fact he dropped 1000 yards after missing 2 seasons of NFL play does not get talked about enough. Smash smash pick

Might actually hurt Ridley if Hopkins isn’t on the field honestly. Ridley isn’t that dude, sorry. But flying around with someone like Hopkins out there on the other side of the field taking attention in the X would help him big time.
If it doesn’t linger at least he should miss a week or two.
Agreed. Ridley balled opposite of Julio Jones. He needs someone with a reputation taking eyes off of him to see value.


Idk why this is so upvoted. In the 12 games in 2020+2021 Julio missed, Ridley had 81 catches for 1,046 and 5 tds. If you extrapolate to a full 16 game season, that's 108/1394/6.7.
Those are elite numbers.
Ridley had a down year last year for sure, imo because he struggles vs press coverage and Flip Taylor did nothing to scheme him out of it, and because he missed a year and a half of football. It's got nothing to do with Julio.

Calvin Ridley was 16th in total targets (DHop 14th), 7th in air yards (DHop 1st) and 3rd in Red Zone targets (DHop 14th) last season.
Will Levis also has a better O-Line and ranks 3rd in air yards per attempt amongst QBs who played 8+ games last season.
If your league is critical of Ridley, you’re going to get a bargain in drafts later this month

With his new situation in Tennessee with Nuk Hopkins I kinda love Ridley, it reminds me a lot of the situation in Atlanta the year he went off with him playing a similar roll that he did that year with Nuk being the Julio Jones of the offense. I feel like with easier routes and matchups Ridley could eat this year
I'll probably avoid him cause I was burned last year. But his ADP isn't bad and in theory he's a good situation to outperform where he's being drafted.

One of my biggest go to’s in fantasy is drafting a guy who didn’t ROI and taking them the next year at a discount. Joe Mixon was solid for me this past year after being disappointing in the first round the year prior. Jumped on grabbing him round 3 the next year and he was worth more than that by end of season. I didn’t have him last year but Pittman was a great example last year. Disappointing in 2022 as a 4th rounder. Smashed his adp in 2023 as a 7th rounder.
I didn’t have shares of Ridley last year cause I was skeptical. But now that people have cooled off on him and he’s dropped 3-4 rounds. I’m targeting him in all my drafts. He doesn’t have to be your WR 1 or even 2. But as a flex play? I would love to have him with the new scheme and coaching staff in Tennessee.
Not saying take every guy who burned you the year prior. But it’s worth considering who were misses the year prior that you can get at a great cost. I’m a big believer that talented players regress in positive and negative ways each year. And I think Ridley is a big candidate for positive regression at his cheapest adp in years.

I'm not a Ridley apologist but he is a good value on a team about to throw it a million times, don't let what he did on a former team affect you
