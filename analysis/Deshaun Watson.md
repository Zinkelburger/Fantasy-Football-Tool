"Rooting for Watson hurts a lot but in his limited time last year he was able to average over 18 ppg and that was with 3 tough divisional games. Over the last 6 seasons, he's put up the 10th best QB stats on a PPG and finished with 376 points in 2020. While I think his high upside rushing days are over, he still averaged over 5 rushes a game last season and has a knack for the endzone. He also has good receiving options and in his games last year with Amari Cooper, was on pace for 95/1600/7. I hate to say it but Deshaun has a lot of upside in drafts if he can have a healthy season."
