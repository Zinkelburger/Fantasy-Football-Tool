"WR: Joshua Palmer (WR58) is near free, and could finish as the top target in a Justin Herbert offense. That is insane to me. Worst case, he finishes as the second target. I just don’t see a world where both Ladd McConkey hits instantly and Quentin Johnson makes a full-180. I refuse to worry about DJ Chark, either. I’m not expecting miracles, but I see an upside where Palmer is a reliable flex."

"Josh Palmer - Should be going way higher, he might be just-a-guy but they trust him."

Big fan. Have him on multiple dynasty rosters. He has the best rapport with Herbert and his only significant competition for targets is Ladd McConkey.
