"He finished wide receiver 11 last year and had a very hot start to the season. He seems to be flying under the radar this year. Of course DJ Moore & Caleb Williams are huge question marks."

"It's a lot to put on a rookie QB, no matter how talented to keep the volume up for multiple targets.

Bears players will probably have highs and lows and are not easy to slot into lineups."

"Agree - Caleb is a great prospect but like we just went through this with other great prospects who didn’t have great rookie seasons in Tua and Lawrence"

"Entire situation is completely different. Scheme, QB, competition, OC, even climate.

I like Keenan as my WR3 this year but don’t want to rely as my WR2."

Allen has been one of the most prolific wide receivers in the NFL during his career. So how the heck is he a sleeper?! Well, as he enters his age-32 season, he has started to plummet in ADP. Last season was quietly one of the best of Allen’s career though, even with him missing time due to an injury. Now he joins a crowded Chicago wide receiver room but should be able to compete for the WR1 role with DJ Moore and play more in the slot in three wide receiver sets. Allen has spent his entire career winning with his route running and nuance, not his athleticism, so he could have more career left than people think. His profile could mean we are getting Larry Fitzgerald-lite. Now tied to another elite young quarterback, Caleb Williams, Allen is the cheaper of the two assumed top options in Chicago, and it is far from a sure thing that he won’t lead this team in targets in 2024.
