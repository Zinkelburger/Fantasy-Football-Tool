Travis Kelce
"Kelce, i dont love there. i feel like he is in the late gronk stage where they're going to pull back on his snaps/touches and just try and make sure he is healthy by the time the playoffs start" "Yep the smart money is on KC continuing to “slow jog” through the regular season in barely 3rd gear, saving their players and best plays for the playoffs.
Andy Reid is not remotely stupid enough to wear Kelce down in regular season games that don’t really mean anything for KC."

"If I get a later pick and he’s there mid to late third, I’d be dumb to not consider it. He’s still the main receiver on the Chiefs." 

"Lastly, the chiefs added Marquise Brown and Xavier Worthy, but I am keeping Travis Kelce in because I simply do not see those guys eating into Kelce's target share enough to significantly impact him. I don't necessarily see him as the TE1 overall, but I still think he's a sure-fire top 5 TE this year."

Prime Kelce of years past went in the early second or even the first. This is the lowest his ADP has been since his sophomore year in 2017, so he doesn't really need to be that same guy in order to beat the value.
