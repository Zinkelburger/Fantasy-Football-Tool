"Saquon Barkley should be a stud this year. Kellen Moore is the new Eagles offensive coordinator. Overall, the Eagles signed Barkley to be their Christian McCaffrey. Kenneth Gainwell and D'Andre Swift had a combined 69 receptions last season. If Barkley just cracks into that, he could easily have 50-60 receptions. You're looking at a super-talented running back in a good offense with more touchdown opportunities for him than Swift had last year and many receptions. He should be a great fantasy back this year, and I recommend drafting him."

"Saquon Barkley - Even with a good line and offense, there are concerns about Hurts vulturing touchdowns and dump-offs, plus mediocre advanced metrics."

"People are freaking out over potential lack of TDs. 1. Saquon hasn’t needed THAT many TDs to produce monster fantasy numbers, 2. It’s not like he’s going to score less than 7-8 anyway which would be good enough, and 3. This is the best offense and oline he’s had in his career, by a massive margin.

Obviously yes, Hurts stealing TDs caps his upside. But he’s such a safe RB1 pick it’s hard to pass up after the top guys are gone"

Upside

    Offensive Line Improvement: Barkley will be running behind one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, which should significantly improve his efficiency. The Eagles' O-line is expected to provide better protection and create more running lanes compared to the Giants' line, which struggled in recent years​ (Philly Sports Network)​​ (FOX Sports)​.

    Play Design and Scheme: Moore's offensive schemes are known for their creativity and efficiency. His track record includes top-five offensive rankings in points per game during his tenure with the Cowboys. This innovation could lead to more opportunities for Barkley to be utilized effectively in various formations, including the pistol formation and RPO (run-pass option) plays​ (Philly Sports Network)​.

    Receiving Potential: Barkley's involvement in the passing game is expected to increase. Moore's history shows a tendency to target running backs frequently, which could boost Barkley's reception totals. While it's unlikely he'll reach his rookie season's receiving stats, he is expected to outperform his recent averages significantly​ (FOX Sports)​.

Drawbacks

    Injury Concerns: Barkley has had a history of injuries that have impacted his performance and availability. This is a risk factor that fantasy managers need to keep in mind.

    Competition for Touches: The presence of other key offensive weapons like Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert means Barkley might not be as heavily leaned on as he was with the Giants. This could limit his overall touch count compared to previous years​ (FOX Sports)​.

    Adjustment Period: Transitioning to a new team and offensive system can take time. Barkley might need a few games to fully integrate and show his peak performance.

Saquon Barkley. All the smart people parade around his poor efficiency metrics and explosive play rate and advanced metrics, and talk about Jalen Hurts not passing to RB and vulturing rushing TDs. But it's Saquon fuckin Barkley and he's finally not the only good player on one of the shittiest offenses in the league, and his only competition is Kenneth Gainwell and Will Shipley...I just love Saquon man and I'd love to have him when he finally has a chance on a good team.

I don't care what people say but when you look at all the first and goal chances the Eagles have this season at the end I bet the majority of them go to Saquon. It's his opportunity to lose.

Saquon Barkley (Better O-Line, Better Offense, Should be involved in the passing game)

I think it's safe to assume that Hurts will poach TDs from Saquon at the goal line, so I would want some discount.
