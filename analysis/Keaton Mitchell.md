Ravens RB Keaton Mitchell, whose season ended with an ACL tear, was placed on the PUP list to start training camp.

His leg injury was a real nasty one.  I would think it will take a whole season to get back to speed.

I scooped up a tremendous number of shares of him with my last pick in Underdog's Weekly Winners tournament (weekly payout Best Ball), which I maxed entries on. This may be the best possible format to have him in imo. But I've also got him sitting in a few IR spots where I picked him up after the redraft was over. I feel so good about this guy as an upside lottery ticket that I didn't even want to make a post to raise awareness on him until I was largely done with drafting my weekly Best Balls and high $ deep leagues. I've taken him in 86 Best Ball drafts out of a few hundred now and he is sitting in IR for several $200+ redrafts, though all my leagues so far have 3 IR to be fair. Just a couple days ago I got him for $1 in auction in a league that starts 3RBs and 2 flex and has 10 bench spots with 4 IR.

Keaton Mitchell averaged 8.4 yards a carry last year as a rookie. This is only on 47 carries before suffering a knee injury, but he did not get a chance until mid-October either. This is the #1 ypc in the NFL last year, if you don't count Derrick Gore's 3 rushes.  Keaton Mitchell was also top 5 in attempts per broken tackle.

Keaton Mitchell had a 20+ yard rush in every single game he played, including one where he only got 3 carries. That's not including the multiple 20+ yard gains he got in 9 receptions either.

Keaton Mitchell plays on one of the most run friendly teams in the league, where the starting RB is 30 years old.
 Well he's a backup, and he tore his ACL in December. That's the cold water. I will note that Hockenson tore his ACL and MCL a week later than Mitchell and people are waiting on him. But of course he's not a RB and is looking at a starting spot when he returns, catching balls from an elite superstar.

Per his injury, I really can't find a lot of good updates. But Harbaugh has said it is progressing well and ahead of schedule. Coach speak blah blah but the vibe I'm getting is that he'll be back somewhere in the game 5-9 range.

I do statistics-related work for a living, so I understand the sample size issue. But 60 opportunities is not 10 opportunities, and this wasn't the case of a guy doing well once against a busted run defense. He did extremely well in every single game he played outside of an average game against the Bengals. I really don't think sample size is the problem here.

Yeah. If you look at the history of running backs coming back from ACL injuries, they usually arenâ€™t very effective when they first come back. I see him more as a Dynasty play for next season.
