"I think Amari Cooper is one of the most underrated receivers in the NFL"

"Amari Cooper- he was on a top 12 WR pace with Watson, is a complete WR talent-wise, and produces every year. He’s going in the 5th round basically because he’s a boring name."

"Was gonna say this too. The inconsistency is so hard to deal with, but it’s tough to not like his ADP.



Agreed, he is the number 1 WR on the team. I want to believe that Jeudy can still be relevant enough to take some coverage off for Cooper (and Moore too), and combine that with Njoku being the threat he is, there’s a good amount more optimism that I have drafting cooper this year

That said, Watson is the X factor and like you mentioned, Cooper has the hit or miss history. Imo he could finish ahead of adp but I also could see him having plenty of mediocre finishes with a few top 12 weeks to solidify him in the WR2 with upside territory…..as always

But that’s why I like him this year."
