"You realize he's going from a great offense with one of the best offensive lines, to the 6th worst offense from last year with the 30th ranked offensive line?"
"He's also splitting with Spears, who they've already indicated is going to be 1A/1B with him. Pollard has done really well in committees before as a change of pace guy, but it's tough that Spears is also a good young back who can catch the ball."
"I'm out on Pollard at his price. He looked awful at times last year, injury or not. And Titans O-line is still hot trash. And I like Levis, but jury is definitely still out on him."
"On Sleeper he’s going RB25 at the end of round 7. That’s between Zamir White and Raheem Mostert.

Pollard is one I go back and forth on. He’s shown the talent before in Dallas as a complementary back. Was the inefficiency and horrible goal line production due to him coming off his injury? Or is he just not cut out for that type of workload?

He’s also going to be playing behind a much worse offensive line on a worse offensive team. He’ll certainly be splitting snaps with Spears. Spears looked better than him last season and the coaching staff has talked about the backfield as an even split."

"I have him at RB24 after rising on him a bit this offseason, but I have a hard time putting him any higher given his situation."

"The Tony Pollard timeline:

Flashes a couple times and fills in well enough in 2021 to pique the interest of fantasy sharps.

2022 - blows up fantasy as a mid-late round player who would go on to be an RB1. He was a WW darling for many, and Reddit hopped on this train late in 2021.

2023 - consensus top 12 pick as new RB1 for Dallas. Disappoints EVERYONE and is a league loser.. the Reddit fantasy darling-hivemind is quick to turn on and eat its own.

2024 - a promising stud of a RB has been cast to near fantasy irrelevance going EVEN LATER THAN HE DID IN 2022!!

This folks, is the ultimate petty and scorn on display. Reddit and the wider fantasy community having been collectively BURNED so badly from Pollard last year that they won’t touch him with a 10 foot pole now.

I’ve never been on the Pollard hype train. This year, I plan to be on the Pollard train. If that offense is any good like it could be, then Pollard very well could return huge value at his ADP. If not much happens and we get more of the same as last year when he was hobbled by injury, then he still returns value. And that’s all that matters."

Tony Pollard is another back I expect will return to form on the Titans. He was struggling with injuries. But also, he has Tyjae Spears to help carry some weight off him.

>> "Tyjae is gonna blow him outta the water"
My only concern is how much everybody is saying this, and usually everybody is wrong. Makes me want to draft Pollard. They paid him a lot of money to come there and presumably start, even if it’s 1A. But same was said for Miles Sanders last year so who knows. They know who Tyjae is and still paid a guy a lot of money to come in above him, even if minorly. More this narrative builds the more I’m thinking Pollard could be a value. I am feeling like it’s a Warren / Najee situation where everybody expects the younger talent to fully supplant, but most likely it’s an even time share nightmare or 60/40 for the vet. So with that outlook I’m starting to favour Pollard at ADP. Same with Javonte but I’m more afraid there.

I’m staying away Tony Pollard, and Tennessee in general.

Agreed. Tony Pollard was basically given the Cowboys backfield and couldn’t produce.. that’s with a much better offensive/OL

Cowboys offensive line couldn’t run block for SHIT. One of the worst run schemes there was as well. Still would avoid pollard because I don’t think he’s a feature back. But the cowboys o line talk has been overrated for years. They don’t have the o line they once had

He will probably be a better player than last year, but now he has a much worse offense and a much better rb behind him. So even if last year wasn’t indicative, his situation is still bad enough to avoid earlier.
