"Ladd McConkey. Going as the WR41, I don’t see how he does worse than that. He’s at worst the number 2 WR for Herbert. Obviously Harbaugh likes to run, but their RB room isn’t great, and their team overall isn’t good enough to have a super slow paced offense where they’re playing from ahead a lot. Josh Palmer has a case here too, I just include Ladd instead because I think he will lead the team in targets. But both could very well be steals."

"Ladd McConkey - Basically a first round pick for an offense that's going to need to use Herbert's arm if they want to compete with Palmer as the only real competition."

 5. This year’s Rashee Rice is Ladd Mcconkey
The rookie WR attached to an elite QB and it takes some patience but by year’s end he’s getting 10 targets a game.

Honestly wouldn’t be surprised if Ladd McConkey leads the group lol. He’s supposedly gonna take over the Keenan Allen role and has great route running/hands

Chargers RBs/WR-Would love to have the lead one but too many questions on who that is

McConkey is this year’s Puca
