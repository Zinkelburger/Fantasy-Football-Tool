I love snagging Courtland Sutton and Dontayvion Wicks near the end of drafts 

"Green Bay Packers wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks has been hyped up a lot this offseason following a surprising rookie campaign. Wicks finished with 39 catches for 581 yards and four touchdowns. He also really came on at the end of the year and totaled at least 40 receiving yards in six of the final eight games. So, it makes sense why the wideout is getting so much hype entering Year 2.

It remains to be seen if playing time will be a problem for him in 2024, though. With Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, and Reed likely occupying the top-three WR spots in Green Bay, where will Wicks fit in on offense? Nonetheless, plenty of opportunities should find him, especially given Watson's injury history."

"Dontavian Wicks - Every film nerd's favorite sleeper and I like the talent + offense too."

Cheapest lotto ticket of GB WRs
60+ yards and/or rec TD in last 4 of 5 games of 2023, including playoffs
Generally speaking: solid camp reports
Christian Watson injury history could mean more playing time
Jordan Love has 4,000+ yards and 30+ TD upside again; avg 244 yds per game last season

I’m surprised Wicks’s (or is it Wicks’) ADP hasn’t gone up more, feel like he’s everyone’s favorite dart throw especially after that preseason TD

Wicks is my personal favorite of the Packers’ young wide receivers. He is a premier route runner and navigates spacing and body control well. I would not be surprised to see Wicks lead this team in all receiving categories in 2024. That being said, Wicks has a long way to go to earn that role. Currently, he sits as the WR4 on the depth chart. His current ADP of WR65 is going to rise as we get further along in the preseason, but if it holds anywhere near that, he is a screaming buy.

Dontayvion Wicks - Packers continue to rotate WRs through camp. If Wicks separates himself from the pack, or Watson continues to struggle with injuries, Wicks could be in line to start in 2 WR sets. If he does, he’d be one of the best values in drafts right now.
