"Brock Purdy was ranked like 50 spots below Caleb Williams in my draft room ADP. Purdy is only 24 years old and just had the type of year Bears fans are HOPING for from Williams some day (4,200 yards and 31 TD).

I'm admittedly new to dynasty leagues, but I'd rather have a 24 year old proven star over a 22 year old maybe star. I guess I'm missing something due to my noob status, but I feel like taking Purdy in round 7 of a 12-team league might be a good move. And then I could focus on RB-WR-TE with my first six picks (3-FLEX league)."

"Brock Purdy - Might also be MVP but does it on extreme efficiency, I think the price is right here if you need QB but not as much as Love."

"The 49ers had the fewest amount of pass attempts in the NFL last season. A lot of his production last season came from big plays. There’s a good chance that he doesn’t get those this year"

"QB: Brock Purdy (QB11) finished QB6 last year. Not particularly mobile, but with a high-powered offense with big playmakers, I love his floor (until he throws four interceptions against Ravens). "

"Purdy at cost is rich. Rather wait for the very late rounds if I'm taking a QB with no rushing upside. J.J. McCarthy might be a pretty good starter, has some rushing upside despite what people think and is going undrafted. Every year good QBs end up on the waiver wire/not on rosters"
