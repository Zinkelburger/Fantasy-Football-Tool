"Healthy Burrow + Healthy Chase = WR1.
Don’t overthink it."

Ja'Marr Chase, entering the 2024 season, has substantial upside in fantasy football due to several key factors. The Bengals have promoted Dan Pitcher to offensive coordinator, maintaining continuity since he has been with the team as the quarterbacks coach. This move ensures stability in the offensive scheme, which is crucial for Chase's performance​ (PFF)​​ (Fantasy Football Calculator)​.

Chase's 2023 season was affected by Joe Burrow's injuries, resulting in a slight dip in his fantasy output. However, when Burrow is healthy, Chase has averaged 19.0 fantasy points per game​ (PFF)​. With Burrow expected to be fully fit and the potential departure of Tee Higgins, Chase could see an increased target share, possibly reaching 30%​ (Pro Football Network)​.

One notable aspect of Chase's game is his deep-threat capability. If the Bengals can re-establish this facet of their offense, it could lead to a spike in Chase's touchdowns and overall fantasy value​ (PFF)​.

On the downside, Chase has been somewhat inconsistent, with more boom/bust potential compared to other elite WR1 options like Justin Jefferson and Tyreek Hill. Over the past two seasons, Chase has had 13 games with fewer than 13 fantasy points, though he also has several games with over 28 points​ (Pro Football Network)​.

Overall, Ja'Marr Chase's potential for the 2024 fantasy football season is high, especially if the Bengals' offense clicks as expected. He is a top-five fantasy wide receiver pick with a draft score of 92 out of 100 in standard fantasy leagues. Keep an eye on the Bengals' offensive dynamics and Burrow's health as the season progresses.

"I think people are too down on the Bengals just given all the injuries to both Chase and Burrow last year. I'm praying I don't get 6th this year because I really don't want to end up drafting Jefferson. He's a great player but I do not trust JJ McCarthy whatsoever."

"Chase.

I think he has a shot at WR1 this year. A healthy Burrow with an axe to grind is going out to light it up. I think the Bengals are going so pass heavy, it won't be funny."

"I'm with you on Chase. We know he's good, we know his QB is good - that's half the battle. There's also been some rumors floating around that they plan to use Chase in that slot/flanker role that we see Lamb, Kupp, Keenan Allen, Godwin etc. play. With Tyler Boyd gone, we could see a lot of Tee Higgins out wide at split end, Chase in the slot, and Jermaine Burton at flanker. Then when they go with 2 WR sets, Chase splits outside opposite Higgins and Burton comes out of the game.

When Cooper Kupp had the WR1 season of all time, he ran the 4th most routes of any player from the slot. When CeeDee Lamb was the WR1 last year (WR3 season of all time behind only Kupp and Jerry Rice), he ran the 4th most routes from the slot. The idea of Ja'Marr Chase in that role is pretty appealing if you ask me."

"Yes, Burrow was injured last year, but in 2022, Burrow was the QB4, and Chase was the WR11 in PPR. He was being drafted as the WR3. Meanwhile, Davonte Adams was being drafted as the WR4 that year, and finished as WR3, and had the QB17 throwing him the ball. There are levels to this, and Chase is a boom or bust WR who should be going closer to the end of the 1st rd."
