I just see him at best being a low-ranked depth piece on the colts again or elsewhere at best. But who knows!

Wonâ€™t be a starter or 1B anywhere but has shown enough to stay in the NFL which could make him roster worthy in deeper formats.
Occasionally you will see late bloomer RBs get some fantasy relevance after three or more years of doing nothing, but that relevance is fleeting and predicting near impossible.

I still believe heâ€™s talented and got screwed over by Shanahan in a classic SF move. Problem is heâ€™s not got the boost of draft capital now so really stuck as a handcuff unless something crazy happens

Guy will be workhorse league winner
Taylor handcuff. Good offense and rb friendly scheme. Sermon is a tier 1 handcuff.

He hasnâ€™t had a 100 yard rushing game in his career. I get the position heâ€™s in but hard to call him tier 1 when he hasnâ€™t done it before. Could be a RBBC easily if JT goes down too. 

RBs past the elite tier are all situation based. Thatâ€™s an elite situation to me with that line + SS.

Heâ€™s a jag but still rosterable as a handcuff, saying heâ€™s pretty good is a stretch imo but everyone has different definitions of good players ðŸ˜‚

I own him, I just identify him as a jag, a Walmart version of Alexander mattison at best, nothing more nothing less. He has value as a handcuff for sure, just far from a good fantasy rb! Itâ€™s totally fine if u think heâ€™s good, I just personally believe heâ€™s just a guy

I still like Goodson as the primary RB2 (6.7 ypa), but Sermon could find a role on 3rd down.

Wait so this is or isnâ€™t Trey Sermonâ€™s year?
Every year is Trey Sermons year
