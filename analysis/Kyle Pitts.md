"Kyle Pitts - Fool me once… emotions tell me I want to fade but that also tells me the market is being emotional too at this price. I like the upside and understand the risk."

"He's burned me two years in a row. How silly will I feel if he breaks out this year on someone else's roster?"

"I’m a Falcons fan. Even in his “historic” rookie year he wasn’t a great fantasy player. That being said, he’s the best football player alive and he will finally break out on my team this year."

"I always passed on him. He never had a proven QB. This year that may change.. [now has kirk cousins]"

I’m willing to roll the dice on Pitts in the 7th or 8th. Not reaching for him. Would not be surprised to see him lined up as a WR 50% of the time. The upgrade at QB is so substantial, it’s worth the risk at that point of the draft imo.

He was already lined up at WR the majority of the time last year, problem is Desmond Ridder is terrible at football.
Yes that’s right. The upgrade at QB is so significant, I think he could be a steal. But I get it. Like I said, I’m not reaching for him. If he falls to me in the 7th (maybe late 6th), I’m doing it.

Saying Pitts sucks has got to be some of the biggest hyperbole I've seen on this subreddit and a really weird flag plant to make, especially after such a huge change in his surroundings. He had one of the best rookie seasons a TE has ever had, and more yards than LaPorta on a worse offense as a rookie. He can fucking ball dude. If he was shit I would be saying it like I've been saying Ridder is shit since the day he was drafted.

How many of those 1st year yards were in the first 6 games when opponents played him as a TE and before the league worked out he is actually just a WR and put a DB on him?
The league worked out how to play him and he hasn’t been anything good since.
