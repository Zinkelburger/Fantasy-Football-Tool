Trey Benson has more missed tackles forced per attempt than these running backs coming out:

Jonathan Taylor

Kenneth Walker

Breece Hall

Jahmyr Gibbs

Basically all of your favorite running backs not named Bijan Robinson. This is important because MTF is a fairly sticky stat, and when you pair that with his prototypical size and speed, it should get folks excited. 

Why did he have so few touches in college? Looks like he had a stretch end of his soph season that was better, but last year it was such a low carry total per game. Just a function of FSU? 

Best guess - he had a pretty gnarly knee injury early in college and the coaches didn't want to push it. Pairing that with the offense having four NFL talents (Coleman, Wilson, Bell, Benson) and Toafili (the other RB) not being a scrub, getting touches was hard. Florida State also blew the doors off of ~6 opponents so he wasn't playing that often. Combine all three of those things and it explains it to me, but the concern is definitely reasonable.

He blew his knee out at Oregon. Then went to FSU. FSU was stacked at RB. The ran 3 backs per game. So that’s why he didn’t get a ton of touches.

This is because he had 18 missed tackles against Duquesne. His numbers fall back to earth a bit if you remove those. Duquesne couldn't tackle at all that game, which is reasonable

I think Trey Benson is the heir apparent to James Conner in 2025. I don't think fantasy enthusiasts are going to get what they want this year. When James is healthy, he's going to get the bulk share of that workload.
