"I think he is a safer pick than AJ Brown, Puka, and Wilson. I think he is clearly better than Olave, MH jr (this year only), Pittman, and lol drake london.

Thats why he is a really solid first round pick imo. I do like the sun god [Amon-Ra St. Brown] more than him though."

"But Jefferson showed last year he was virtually QB proof. After coming back from injury (I discount the Raiders game because that was his first game back) he was 7.5 catches for 119 yds with 0.5 TDs per game. That's still an elite stat line with guys like Nick Mullins and Jaren Hall."

"Upside:
Justin Jefferson remains one of the most elite wide receivers in the NFL, consistently showcasing his talent regardless of the quarterback situation. In 2023, despite missing seven games due to a hamstring injury and losing starting QB Kirk Cousins, Jefferson managed to finish fifth in points per game. He commanded a significant target share (28%) and maintained impressive performance metrics even with backup QBs. Heading into the 2024 season, Jefferson is expected to continue being the primary offensive weapon for the Minnesota Vikings. His elite skills, combined with offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell's system, provide a solid foundation for another top-tier fantasy season​ (FantasyPros)​​ (PFF)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:
The main concern for Jefferson's fantasy value in 2024 is the uncertainty at the quarterback position. With Kirk Cousins' future in Minnesota uncertain due to his age and injury, the Vikings may start the season with Sam Darnold or a rookie QB. This change could impact Jefferson's consistency and ceiling, as quarterback performance is crucial for wide receiver production. Additionally, any lingering effects from his previous hamstring injury could pose a risk, although his history suggests he can overcome such setbacks​ (RotoBaller)​​ (https://www.fantasylife.com)​."

JJ this year is gonna be like what my Jamarr was last year. Which means I’m not drafting him! [due to QB situation, Sam Darnold]
