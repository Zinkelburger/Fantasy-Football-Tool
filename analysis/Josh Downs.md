WR Josh Downs suffered a high ankle sprain during practice today, per source. The outlook right now is that Downs could miss about a month but the Colts are sorting that out. A key piece to Colts offense goes down.

he was my most common late round target but this injury just causes nothing but season-long issues

Buying AR and Colts stock but his passing won’t be polished enough in what is essentially his rookie season to support Pittman, Downs, and AD. Think the play with this team is either AR + Pittman or just JT. Think owning anything besides those 3 is useless in redraft, coming from someone who loves Downs. 

    I think Downs has higher value in redraft.

I would argue the opposite. Richardson, to put it bluntly, has shown no ability to pass at the NFL level. He might get there, but I have reservations it'll be this season.

    I don’t think there’s a long career for a receiver that stands 5’9” and weighs 170 pounds.

Size doesn't really matter much these days for wide receivers, the rules have made it much more friendly for them. Richardson will have a tough time supporting 1 WR, let alone 3.

This isn’t a shot at Downs, he’s talented. But his situation doesn’t make him a viable fantasy asset until something else happens.

Adonai Mitchell will be serious competition for him, also I don't see Richardson supporting Pittman well enough let alone a WR2.

Downs played really well last year and was held back a bit by an injury. He's almost a lock to smash his ADP (140+), but he's not super likely to beat out Pittman as the #1 target earner which limits his upside.. Still, he went 68/771/2 with a nagging knee injury last season, so there's pretty good odds he improves on that, and that's a lot better than most of the guys in this range are going to do. Talent-wise he's also established himself as an elite separator and had very similar metrics to Jayden Reed, with the main difference being that Downs wasn't given a bunch of designed TD opportunities.
