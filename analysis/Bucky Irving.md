I agree with a lot of others that have been posted but Iâ€™m going with Bucky Irving. TB has been swinging in the draft for a knockout RB for years and they never really seem to have it. Irving was fast as hell at Oregon last year got great YPC (6+) on the ground and also had 50+ receptions in the passing game. I think if he gets the opportunity he will impress.

Yeah I watched a lot of Bucky play and I liked what I saw. I know he's undersized and his combine wasn't great, but he just seems like he's good at football. Who else is there besides Rachaad White? I feel like he'll get chances
