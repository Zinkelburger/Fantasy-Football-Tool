 Now you may still say - so what? This guy is washed! Although you may be right, Mike Gesicki signed a 1 year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals and is currently appearing as the #1 tight end on the depth chart. From what we can see, we know that Gesicki had a high route run to snap ratio so if he is on the field he is more likely to be running routes than blocking.

He is now playing with the best quarterback he has ever played with in Joe Burrow and with very little tight end competition (Drew Sample and Tanner Hudson with neither having more than 352 yards in a season). If we remove Burrow's injury riddled 2023 season, he targeted tight ends 14.6% and 15.0% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Another factor is the loss of Tyler Boyd should open up more targets and with Higgins and Chase having contract disputes we don't know if this could play a role in their performance as we have seen slow starts or injuries to hold outs (or hold ins for this case).  If we extrapolate and estimate these numbers and we say Gesicki takes 15% of the Tight End targets we are looking at roughly ~80-90 targets when looking at Burrow's healthy years playing. He has a 62.7% catch rate which puts him at ~56 catches and 600-650 yards and 5 TDs which would put him in the 10-12 range in PPR. I think this could potentially jump to 800+ yards as Gesicki is playing with the best QB he has ever played with, has little Tight end competition and when he is on the field, he is running routes. I don't think it is crazy to see Gesicki bounce back and finish within the top 12 - and maybe top 8 if my estimates prove to be correct.

TLDR: Gesicki has had a couple brutal years but look for him to finish top 12, maybe top 8 because of playing with the best quarterback of his career, little tight end competition and understanding that when he is on the field he is running routes at a high rate. I would give him a floor of 50/600/5 and a ceiling of 70/800/7.

"I want whatever you’re on to make something this passionate about Mike Gesicki"

"Alright now let’s explain why he’s been trending in the wrong direction.

The man CANT block that’s it. He just can’t do it for some ungodly reason and he’s not fast which just leaves him to be a contest jump ball catcher that’s it. The reason he finished 7th and 13th is cause my team didn’t have anyone to throw too so he HAD to play"

"We’ve had several years of new tight ends coming to cincinatti and trying to convince ourselves burrow will make them relevant. It’s not happening"
