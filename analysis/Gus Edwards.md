Gus Edwards. RB40 for a guy who is going to be the starter is crazy. He also should be getting most of the goal line work, and honestly doesn’t really have anyone behind him that scares me in terms of him losing work. I’m not expecting anything amazing but no reason he can’t hit flex numbers based off volume 

"Gus Edwards feels like he can be the Mostert of last year"

"Lots of fantasy gold to be found in ambiguity. Roman ALWAYS has top offenses."

"That’s a shame. He was ineffective except at the goalline, and he was only effective for one solid stretch. Chargers aren’t gonna have nearly as many redzone opportunities as the Ravens just did."
