I absolutely will not draft. Juju Smith-Shuster, Miles Sanders etc. they will never make my squad ever again.

Your two “do not draft” players are guys being drafted at consensus ADP or #261 and #310???

Sanders was a veteran RB brought in to a new team on a generous (by RB standards) contract, and with corresponding expectations, to be that team's primary rusher, only to wind up disappointing the team, along with any fantasy managers unfortunate enough to have drafted them.
