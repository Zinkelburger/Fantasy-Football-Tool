I'm not going to sit here and tell you he is going to be a league winner or how he is the best RB ever BUT the guys he is going around are insane. JK Dobbins, Zach Charbonnet, and Blake Corum have higher average ADPS. Now the main argument against Chuba is Jonathon Brooks who everyone thinks is gonna be awesome but at the same time he is gonna miss at least the first 4 weeks of the year and is still a rookie that missed all of training camp.

I rather have Chuba than Devin Singletary or Nick Chubb who are going 50 picks higher. He was RB26 last year and I think he could finish even higher this year unless I'm totally missing something.

Hubbard is a bad play for the later weeks when tourneys are won. That said, even in traditional redraft leagues, you should probably expect Hubbard to fall off as the season progresses and Brooks—the much better talent—takes over.

So, if you’re drafting him, you’re doing so with the intention of starting him in September. And realistically, you probably have better RBs and even flexes on your roster by the time you draft Chuba.

If you have an IR, how would you feel about drafting Brooks at the end of 7th, then drafting Hubbard at his ADP round 10/11? Stash Brooks in your IR then go get a K or DST

Chuba as the lead back is good for low-end RB2 production. He was RB24 or something last year after he won the starting job from Sanders. Coupled with a looming promising rookie behind him, his end-of-season projection is really low as a result. And the Panthers are projected to have an awful offense again according to Vegas implied totals, so your assertion that the Panthers offense is going to magically improve isn't necessarily fact. 

Here me out...Hubbard Ranked 11th in RB touches last season with 277. He was not particularly efficient with those touches as he averaged only 10.7 Points per game.
He was RB29 last year in an awful offense.With the news that Jonathon Brooks will miss the first “3-4” weeks coming off of an ACL tear, the opportunity is ripe for Hubbard to continue to get volume.
Plus there’s a new coach in town. Dave Canales force feeds the run game. 
Look at Rachaad White last year: efficient? No. A good running back? We’re not entirely sure. Yet, he was golden in fantasy football because volume is King! 
 You have to make the playoffs to win your league.

Chuba Hubbard should get ELITE volume the first month of the season. I can see him as a really nice RB2 depending on how good Bryce Young is. Remember the Panthers are doing whatever they can to get Bryce Young going, otherwise the whole front office might be gone.
Right now, Hubbard is going as RB 50 on ESPN, pick 165.7. If I can get an RB2 for the first month of the season at a discounted rate, then I’m all in for that. Especially if I use a Zero or Hero RB strategy. 

I don't know about that to be honest, the goal is to win the whole league, so drafting for the back half at the expense of the front half may make more sense overall. But hey, spending some late draft capital to secure a playoff spot isn't the worst idea. Plus its hard to predict the future, much easier to predict the early weeks. Your "late season" pick could get injured, idk.

The only pushback I have on Hubbard is his efficiency with the work he gets. Now I haven't really heard any reports on him getting better in the off season, which while not a red flag in itself, is a yellow flag with Brooks now on the roster. I think Hubbard is a better add in a Zero RB build but I think I can do better if I took a Hero approach.
     

I'm big on Chuba this year, because of where you can get him. Last year when he got the oppertunity to take most the carries, he had some solid games.
I'm also in the camp of thinking that Brooks will smash next year, but I don't see the coaches needing to rush him out and give him a big work load. Chuba is on a contract year as well. If the team isn't going to make the playoffs, why would you rush out a rookie who missed camp and OTA's, that is coming off an injury, for a team that won't make the playoffs. I personally see more of a split, like a 1A/1B type role for Brooks.
