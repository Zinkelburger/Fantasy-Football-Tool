"For me it’s Alvin Kamara.. i think he will have elite usage and still put up great numbers with no real threat besides injury riddled Kendre Miller."

"The Saints hired some new staff members to help Kamara remain effective even at his age if he can stay healthy.  While I expect a transition to Kendre Miller over time and possibly even towards the end of this season, I expect Kamara to remain what he has been every year, which is at least an RB2, if not RB1, in PPR.  Derek Carr loves checking down to Kamara, which gives him value as a receiver, and honestly, there aren't many better sure-bets at receiver besides Olave than Kamara."

"I think there are legit concerns for him this year. He looked bad rushing and I think the saints as a team might be downright terrible. I feel you are gonna have to rely on all those dump offs for 3 yards happening again. Definitely not saying that can’t happen but he seems 1 dimensional at this stage of his career"

"Was it Kamara or was it the Saints atrocious OL and grossly misusing him? Carmichael consistently ran him up the gut like he's Derrick Henry. That's not his game, he needs to get the ball in space."

Alvin Kamara (The Shanahan system guys that came over should help him see higher volume in more creative ways) 

 I know the whole team is pretty bad. I know Derek Carr is a shell of his old self. I know the OL is one of (if not the) worst in the league. I know Jamaal Williams and Taysom Hill figure to play into the run game more this year. I know that his efficiency isn't what it used to be. I just can't get over that Kamara was: 1st in Targets/Game, 5th in Opportunities/Game, 6th in Touches/Game, and 5th in Points/Game among RBs. He's averaged 15 PPG or more in 5 out of 7 seasons in .5PPR. You're telling me that's the 45th overall pick? The 17th RB off the board? 

To add to the Kamara hype, Kendra miller is essentially the devil to Dennis Allan. I have never liked the idea of drafting Kamara and even I’m thinking he might be a great value
