"Ezekiel Elliott is cooked.  Based on last season with the Patriots, he's better than I expected, but he has carried a significant workload in his career.  Elliott is the only competition the Cowboys brought in for Rice Dowdle.  Dowdle could easily find himself in the top 24 in the Tony Pollard role based purely on the volume he could see in a terrific offense in Dallas.  The Cowboys are okay with giving out volume to their top back and can't give that to Elliott at his age and mileage so that Dowdle could see a good share of carries."

"He could get a lot of red zone carries, he's a bigger back. Round 10 is good value."

"Zeke is going to infuriate those of you that take Dowdle/whoever we bring in. We needed Zeke back for two very obvious reasons - pass blocking and short yardage. Whatever the split ends up being, Zeke is going to see the field a ton on third downs and near the goal line.

I’m going way back now but I expect this to be similar to Julius Jones/Marion Barber. Julius saw nearly all the early down work between the 20s, and Barber handled the third downs and red zone touches.

To be clear I’m not saying don’t draft Dowdle, I think he’ll have value. I’m just saying Zeke is gonna play enough in those situations that it’s gonna drive people nuts."

Dallas is coming off a year in which they were: 1st in Points/Game, 1st in Red Zone Opportunities/Game, and 5th in Plays/Game. Now their RB room (which is admittedly largely uninspiring) is the 2nd cheapest in all of fantasy? Just seems like a glaringly obvious value opportunity with very little risk.
