On the Raiders, Brock Bowers will be in competition for the number target with Jakobi Meyers and could lose snaps to last years second round pick Michael Mayer

Is Mayer the next Sam LaPorta? Looked really solid over the last two weeks as his snap count has been increasing, and he seems to be used as a reliable 3rd option and a sneaky deep threat. With most people out there struggling with TE options, could Mayer be a sneaky pickup this week? 

I've cycled through Hunter Henry, Luke Musgrave, and Logan Thomas already. Sure, whatever.

Can anyone give any insight on Michael Mayer. He seems like a legit break out candidate with them also taking in Bowers. I haven't seen one mention of Mayer anywhere. How come?
The Raiders are ass and drafted a generational TE
