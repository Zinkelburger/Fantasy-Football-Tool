High upside QB. Got hurt last year, so will be available to later, maybe 6th round.

"Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson should be a hot target in fantasy drafts this summer. Despite playing in just four games (two full games) in his rookie year due to a shoulder injury, Richardson showed a lot of great things on the field.

The former Florida product threw for 577 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 136 yards and four touchdowns. Richardson also scored over 20 points in both of the games he started and finished in 2023. With the 22-year-old now past his shoulder injury, he should be in for a big season due to his rushing upside."

Anthony Richardson Got Savagely Mocked by the Bengals at Joint Practice: 'Is That All He Does is Run?' 
Which makes this statement from the defenders even more concerning. He's in a practice where he knows he can't get tackled but is still abandoning the pass to run wide? That's not good. He should be chucking it down field for practice. I feel like my Pittman stock is falling

The irony is that AR went on to throw multiple tds in the team portion of practice, with Burrow throwing 2 picks.
No one cares about the actual facts, they only want blurbs about cornerbacks talking shit, cause that never happens in joint practices.

when Richardson gets injured. As a gator, I love the guy. But he went out half a season for an injury sustained doing a dance move at the team hotel. I’m not sure he’s ever played a full injury-free season.

I’m not sure any team wants their franchise quarterback to be taking all of the goal line carries after he was just out for a full year due to being overly aggressive. They will opt to use JT [the running back] when they can IMO, especially after paying him a ton of money

Exactly my thought. His ADP is too rich for my taste with him being such an unknown. People are drafting him hoping that he'll be the next Lamar, when they could simply just draft Lamar.

It's like the Family Guy mystery box bit: "Lamar is Lamar, but AR could be anything. He could even be Lamar!"

Rising qb is a nice way to describe a guy yet to play his 5th game. 
Apparently the 5th ranked QB on the season too. AR is getting hyped to oblivion.
That's almost entirely bc his rushing ability anyways. Not exactly a point in favor for his wr2 even if he lives up to the hype

Watching this preseason game vs the Bengals 2nd teamers and outside of a great first drive, he is struggling out there. A brutal pick-6 on the second drive and then two 3and-outs. A strip-sack on an attempted scramble resulting in a fumble on the next drive, it looks pretty shaky rn…This should be a dress-rehearsal for the season but looks like there is still a ways to go until AR15 is making solid completions. 

People need to remember that you don't need to be a good QB to be a good fantasy QB.
Look at Justin Fields literally last year

You're still missing the point and evaluating Richardson's merits as a QB in actual football.
Do I think Richardson is a bad deal at his ADP? Yes.
But people keep talking about his accuracy issues as if nobody has ever considered them. Everyone knows he's not a great passer. People just don't care because he's got the rushing floor.

I know he’s got a lot of athleticism, but I’ve seen nothing from him that indicates he can be an effective passer at the NFL level. I know rushing for a QB is important in fantasy, but I don’t think he’s a good QB. I’m out on him at his current price.
