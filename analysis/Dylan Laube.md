Upsides:
    Pass-Catching Ability: Laube excels as a receiver out of the backfield, which could earn him a role as a third-down back, especially in PPR leagues.
    Opportunity: The Raiders' backfield lacks established depth beyond Zamir White, giving Laube a chance to emerge as a passing-down specialist.

Downsides:
    Undersized for the NFL: At 5'9" and 206 pounds, Laube might struggle with the physical demands of the NFL, particularly on early downs.
    Fumbling Issues: Laube had some fumbling concerns in college, which could limit his trust with the coaching staff.

Could be a good dart throw in the final rounds
