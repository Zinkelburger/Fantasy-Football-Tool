I like shakir to have the most recs and provide the safest floor week to week. Iâ€™m planning to just draft Josh Allen and whichever WR falls

As far as the Bills go, I feel like Curtis Samuel and Shakir both have a good shot at being a main target for Josh Allen behind Dalton Kincaid. And their ADPs are so low, you can snag either for pretty cheap.

Shakir isn't new ti the system and Samuel seems to have a high ceiling considering last season Dotson was the hot topic and Samuel was one of the best mid season wire pickups.
