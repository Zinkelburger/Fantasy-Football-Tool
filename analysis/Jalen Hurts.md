"Hurts had a lot of TDs from that tush push and idk if they'll have that success again without Kelce. I'd have to hear from an eagles fan though"

"At QB, I'd love to grab Hurts here as my overall QB1 but likely miss on him"

"Jalen Hurts has thrown 17 TDs and 0 INTs at Eagles camp thus far.

At this point in camp last season, he had 7 TDs and 3 INTs.

So either Hurts is about to be an MVP candidate, or the Eagles secondary has gone from bad to abysmal."
