"DK Metcalf and Michael Pitmann are both prototypical X receivers that have questions on their roles in their offenses and overall situation. Pittman is a hard fade (lack of volume through the air and red-zone) for me here."

Buying AR and Colts stock but his passing won’t be polished enough in what is essentially his rookie season to support Pittman, Downs, and AD. Think the play with this team is either AR + Pittman or just JT. Think owning anything besides those 3 is useless in redraft, coming from someone who loves Downs. 

Pittman did well with Richardson last year. He was clearly Richardson's favorite target and got plenty of production. Even even with the small sample size I wouldn't worry about him. 

Pittman only finished as a top 30 WR in 1 of the 4 weeks Richardson started last year.

AR being at QB is bad for both JT and Pittman. I’m not sure how people aren’t figuring that out. He’ll be taking TDs away from JT at the goal line all year and isn’t a good enough passer to support Pittman.
