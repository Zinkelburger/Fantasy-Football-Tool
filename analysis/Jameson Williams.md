"My prediction would be Jameson Williams. He’s in a similar situation as Aiyuk in terms of being the WR2 on a high octane offense. Last year, you could see them designing plays to get the ball in his hands. They let go of Josh Reynolds. He’s being constantly praised for his growth / development in the media and by the coaches.

I think he’s going to have a solid season and I’m making sure he’s on my roster this year. Honestly, I might have 3-4 lions players on my team this year (keeping Laporta, Monty keeps falling to me in mocks, grabbing Jamo in round 10, and considering taking Goff too)."

"I like this take too. Goff will throw for 4000 yds always.

1000 of those yards will go to J Williams this year and people will act surprised.

I also think Lions, much like the 49ers last year, are a top 4 offense in 2024"

 Pros:

    High IRL draft capital

    On a good offense

    91 vacated targets

    Dan Campbell has been talking about his work ethic and plans for an expanded role

Cons:

    Limited production in 2 previous years

    Amon Ra, Laporta and Gibbs might be in front of him on the targets pecking order

    Goff isn’t a huge deep-ball thrower

    He’s kinda small


Feels like Gabe Davis. 
Who has been SO frustrating for fantasy. Sonic booming out of nowhere and then crickets. You just can't rely on him in close matchups. If he's there reasonably late I'll grab him I guess

I feel like he’s a must have in bestball leagues, gonna be a headache in start/sit leagues
Boom or bust



It’s a run heavy offense and he’s going to be the 3rd passing option behind ARSB and LaPorta.
He is going late enough where he could outperform his ADP, but either way I doubt he’ll be very fantasy relevant, definietly not someone you’ll be starting

Jameson is splash player. The strong rushing game and ARSB and Laporta being possession receivers is going to bring defenders in and give Jameson opportunities. He can get 10-12 pts off of 1 plays. He's not going to be a consistent start, but a nice flex or bye week option.
