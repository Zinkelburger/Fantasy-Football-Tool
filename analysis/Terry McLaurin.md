"Terry is currently ranked #31 on FantasyPros WR ECR in half PPR. I believe his ADP is WR #32, with many WR2’s on their team going before him. Jayden Daniels is being ranked as QB #12, obviously there is a lot of rushing ability there but he needs to throw to someone and Terry is Washington’s unequivocal #1 pass catching option. Is Terry being undervalued at his current spot, and could he be a top 15 WR with some consistent QB play?"

"IMO, the savings you gain by him being undervalued isn’t too much of a needle mover and you might find greater delta elsewhere."

"The upside would be he’s your WR5 giving you flexibility on injuries, trade value and matchup plays. Downside is minimal given his ADP."

"McClaurin continues to be that “value” I am looking for as my WR2/3"

McLaurin. He always drops and gets to the point where I can’t shake the feeling that he’s a value at his price 

Except Terry isn’t hyped this year and can be had for relatively cheap. With great reports of Jayden in camp so far and limited receiving competition, he has tremendous upside.
