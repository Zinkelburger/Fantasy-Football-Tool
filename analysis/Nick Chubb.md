"Jerome Ford was a decent, touchdown dependent RB2. Everything will depend on whether Chubb still has it, but indications are that he won't be rushed back. Thinking he's is a little cheap in redraft and dynasty.


I think it's more about them expecting Chubb to miss a big chunk of the season and wanting more depth in the backfield. Possibility they do favor Foreman for short yardage/RZ, but his contract is cheap and they trusted Ford last year. I'd expect Ford to see more of the split and getting passing looks, and Foreman to be more of a bruiser and maybe see the goal line looks. If Ford loses out on goal line looks, that definitely hurts his stock but he'd still have value. Foreman's value hinges on if he gets those GL looks and if he is able to take enough early down work from Ford. 

 Chubb could be an outlier, but injury history and age are working against him. I'm rooting for him to be healthy and productive once he returns, guy is one of the best pure rushers in the league. 
"100%

Who doesn’t love that number? That’s the percentage of times that you’ve been wrong when you’ve ever doubted Nick Chubb.

The Fucking Best

Nick Chubb is the fucking best. Hands down the best runner of the football since AP. Have you seen him run? It is textbook. It is mechanically perfect. It is zenith."

"The good thing about being down to “buy low” on Chubb and Ford is that by the end of the season either way you can say “I knew it!”

"Remember when AP tore his ACL and MCL and all the experts were saying he'd never come close to who he was before the injury? What happened that next season?

Not saying the doctors or "experts" are always wrong or that you shouldn't listen to them. But freaks of nature like AP and Chubb are the outliers where you should at least consider ignoring the docs"

"If there’s anyone to pull off a solid season after what he went through, it’s him"

"Squatting is so much different from running and making cuts. It's good to see him building strength back, but I believe ACL and MCL tears affect lateral stability quite a bit. He may play this season, but a second multi ligament tear to the same knee is not something I want to bet on unless it's best ball or little to no cost in redraft."

"I always reference AP in cases like this, too, but as a "don't expect the same result, AP was literally a genetic outlier, and he didn't have a prior major injury to that knee."

It was the first trauma to his ACL and MCL, and good ole Dr. James Andrews said something like "AP's knee was the healthiest I had ever seen in a pro athlete, it looked like a 13 year old boy's who had never played sports: No evident wear, no scar tissue, no bone spurs, nothing. We just don't see that in a pro athlete's knee, typically.""
