Lot of upside

He didn’t exactly light it up like Laporta or Kincaid in his second half season, but he was a top prospect and will have Love at QB. 

It's the same reason managers struggle with the WR room for fantasy: last year they spread the ball around so much. There wasn't a consistent pass catcher you could count on week in and week out. Given it was almost everyone's first year together, there's a chance that evolves into something more concrete this year. But I don't think anyone can predict that, hence the reason most struggle to draft WR or TE due to the ambiguity on a week to week basis. Definitely more valuable in best ball, but could be tricky in H2H. 

Kraft and Musgrave bring different elements to the offense. Kraft is a dirty work kind of guy, where Musgrave is more of the young Jimmy Graham or Sam LaPorta mold of really big receiver. And I think that gives Musgrave significantly more potential in fantasy. But I also agree that neither is likely to be a fantasy asset in 2024. It’s not just GB having both of them, but also 5 WRs who are legit playmakers. Too many mouths to feed. And if there is a breakout fantasy star among the pass catchers, my money is on Watson or Wicks.

Musgrave has the easier path to fantasy relevance. Kraft is very much a “dirty work” type of TE, while Musgrave is pretty strictly a receiving threat. Musgrave will run the more valuable routes and have a much higher likelihood of a fantasy relevant week. If I’m taking a flier on a low volume TE, that’s the one I want.
Musgraves an do what Kraft was doing. Kraft can’t do what Musgraves can do.  Kraft played well, but comparing how he looked running 5 yard dump offs to how Musgrave looked running go routes, doesn’t exactly make sense. They didn’t play the same role at all.  Musgraves is far and away the superior receiver and he was ahead of Kraft on the depth chart for a reason and will be again.  

Kraft was in a sling last month and i heard it was a peck injury. They’re being pretty cagey about it but i think its possible that it lingers and Kraft either isnt on the feild or isnt 100% to start the season. This makes me feel better about drafting Musgrave in best ball.

The packers offense this year is gonna be a shit show. They’re gonna spread it around so much and frustrate fantasy owners, real fans will be happy.
