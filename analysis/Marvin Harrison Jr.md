"He's being drafted at his ceiling this year imo, which generally means I won't be taking him"

"His ceiling is a top 5 WR. He’s in arguably the best situation for any WR in the league right now, and he’s one of the best WR prospects of the 21st century. Other rookies have boomed before, MHJ absolutely has the potential to hit that ceiling too.

Whether he does or not is a big risk naturally, since he’s a rookie and an unknown in the NFL. But the ceiling is most certainly there."

"Marvin Harrison Jr. - Undoubtedly a stud but expecting a top-8 finish from a rookie WR is ambitious."
