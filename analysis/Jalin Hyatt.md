Jalin Hyatt’s breakout game went unnoticed today
5 Receptions, 104 yards
While he hasn’t been very good, every game where he’s had a few receptions (only 2 games), he has produced so efficiently.
3 receptions vs. BUF (75 yds)
5 receptions vs. NE (104 yards)
Seems like DeVito and Tyrod both have targeted him way more than DJ as well.
People forget this guy had DJax type speed coming into the league, certainly is a playmaker when he gets the ball in his hands. NYG has a BYE next week but keeping an eye on him wouldn’t be a bad thing..

I don't think it went unnoticed. I think he just plays for a terrible team that no one wants to play anyone on except Saquan.

Because most people would hardly qualify 5 for 104 as a "breakout" game. That would put him around WR 20 in full PPR on average most weeks this season, and he's done it once. If he continued putting up 15+ fantasy points per game over the next few weeks, then you could call this his breakout game. If he goes back to putting up his 3.4 average over the next few games, I doubt you would still consider this to be his breakout game.
