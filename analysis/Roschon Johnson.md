RB1 sometimes last year, but I think he's RB3 now on the Bears behind D'Andre Swift. Short end of a RBBC. Idk man.

"His 561 total yards and two scores on 115 total touches (4.35 yards per carry) proved he can contribute on all three downs with ample-enough efficiency when on the field. Yet, Johnson never saw 10 carries or rushed for over 40 yards in a single game last year"

Roschon Johnson - I think the Bears could have a season that mirrorâ€™s the Texans breakout last year. If that does happen I want to keep an eye on the RB most likely to get TDs for the bears. Swift is explosive but may be the least suited to a goal line role of any RB in the league. Roschon is also a much better pass protector than Swift and could get passing down snaps.
