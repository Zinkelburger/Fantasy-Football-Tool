"Take all the “non-rushing” guys off this list, unless they’re throwing 50+ TD’s a season. Then you’ll be able to better identify who can be that guy."

"I agree Hurts, Allen and Mahomes have the easiest path to the QB1, but I’d say Kyler and Burrow are in that next tier that can reach it, maybe Stroud too.

How many QBs outside of Mahomes could throw for 40 TDs this year? To me it’s Burrow, then maybe Stroud, and that’s it.

Murray I think has a chance to reach 40 TDs between passing and rushing. He has arguably the best pass catching duo of his career in Marv and McBride, and with such a bad defence that offence is going to have to try keeping up by pushing the ball down field."

"Jayden Daniels going full RG3 and staying healthy is probably the last guy on the list who it's conceivable could do it. Washington always down, 500-800 yard rush ability... again, it's a longshot, but it's not impossible."

"Hurts, Allen, Mahomes, Lamar are obviously the top candidates.

I’d say Kyler, Stroud, Burrow, and Richardson could as well. Burrow and Stroud less likely because less rushing but it’s not insane to imagine a fantastic season throwing the ball from them either."

"We collectively reached on so many of the mid-round guys last year who didn't do great (Herbert, Burrow, Fields, Lawrence...the only one who did well was Dak) because there were more unknowns (rookies, new teams, bad starting QBs, injuries, etc.). This year, it seems many of those situations got clarified and that 5-13 group is just so big with only minor preferential differences between them, it doesn't seem worth it to take a QB early. You can get 2 solid guys with a decent chance of 1 emerging as a top 6 fantasy QB."
