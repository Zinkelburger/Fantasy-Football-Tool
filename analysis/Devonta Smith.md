"Maybe Smith. The eagles offensive coaching should improve a lot on last year and I could see Kellen Moore deploying Smith similar to how Keenan Allen was used."

"Devonta Smith - Underrated in the same vein as Waddle playing robin. I think he's a great player in for a huge season and a huge value with a pass-focused regime change."

Do not draft:
Devonta smith because AJ brown can just threaten his friendship with Hurts every game on the sideline like last year and get Devonta written out of the game plan.
