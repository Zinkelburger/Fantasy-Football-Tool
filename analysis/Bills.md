Watching Bills news and following camp this is what is coming out so far:

    Allen and Shakir have a good chemistry spilling over from last season and Josh likes him a lot

    Kincaid is expected to take big leaps in production and likely will

    Samuel is expected to be used in a multi-functional role so it’s difficult to figure out exactly what it will be as a fan

    Coleman is a solid rookie making big catches in camp. They are expecting a lot from him but he is a rookie and isn’t facing real game play.

    Hollins so far is relevant. Josh likes him as does everyone else. He sounds like the 4th guy as of now but there’s a few weeks to go.

    Knox is tough to say. He’ll be relevant in the red zone and especially the end-zone. He’ll be a sneaky target when on the field at all times.

    Cook should get a lot of targets this season…one would think. If Samuel is used out of the backfield as he’s been practicing and Davis becomes a pass-catching RB then it’s difficult to say if Cook would come out or line up as wing or as slot/WR. His talent makes him really flexible.

    (Ray) Davis I addressed above.

 It wouldn’t surprise me if the target leader(s) were Shakir & Kincaid throughout the season. I could see each one getting 100+ easily, even 120+
