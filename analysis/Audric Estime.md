Estime could become the goal line back but he had a bad fumble already. Hard to trust at the moment. Williams looks more reliable to be goal line back

Payton does like utilizing multiple backs, we saw Ingram and Kamara feast back in the day. Pretty sure if Williams and McLaughlin are cooking, Estime may just be in to give either guys a blow.
