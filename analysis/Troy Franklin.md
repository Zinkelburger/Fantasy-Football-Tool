In response to "People love Rome Odunze and not like Troy Franklin purely because of weight" (Troy Franklin weights 35 pounds less)
Saying 35 pounds of muscle doesnâ€™t matter is like saying Derrick Henry and Gus Edwards have the same talent but Henry just weighs more. You brush aside film things too easily. Some of the smartest people in the world at this and some of the most reputable big boards have Rome Odunze as closer to being the best WR prospect in most years.

Franklin would not be the best WR prospect for anyone in any year.
