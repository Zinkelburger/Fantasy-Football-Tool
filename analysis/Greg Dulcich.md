Greg Dulcich (TE 36, ADP 281): Dulcich is probably my favorite guy up here and is likely to be the one that I take my flier on. He is pretty much free with an ADP that low and has shown some fantasy pedigree in the past. Over the 10 games he played in his rookie season, Dulcich averaged 5.5 targets a game for 3 catches and 41 yards per game. Now, Jerry Jeudy is gone and the Broncos number two target behind Sutton is wide open. Marvin Mims and Josh Reynolds are good receivers but Dulcich has shown the flashes in the past that he could beat them out. Dulcich has been killing it in camp and I expect his ADP to rise over the course of the month but he's my pick to break out this year. Of course I do need to mention some negatives here. Bo Nix is the QB in Denver and that is not very promising for this offenses prospects. Dulcich also has quite the injury history missing most of last season and a chunk of his rookie season.
