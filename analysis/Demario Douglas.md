"I think Demario Douglas will get peppered with targets from Brissett. Not a terrible dart throw for WR3 upside in PPR. Can't imagine they'll be a whole lot of TDs though."

"New England Patriots wide receiver Demario Douglas was one of the few bright spots in that offense last season. After being drafted in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft, Douglas exceeded all expectations as a rookie. He finished with a team-leading 561 yards on 49 catches.

Those numbers were only a taste of what's to come for the 23-year-old. With a better quarterback situation in 2024, Douglas should only see more chances in the receiving game. He could be a sneaky selection later in fantasy drafts because a breakout campaign could be in store."

DeMario "Pop" Douglas
I’m a long time Pats fan. Agreed.

Pop is very difficult to contain. He gets separation with deceptive route running and he’s lightning after the catch. He’ll move the chains and also break a few slants for TDs.

Polk appears to be a true number one. I’m a little less sure of how much value he provides out of the gate. Bourne will certainly play a bunch and produce some weeks.

Pop is the safest, steadiest guy, imo. Polk has an unknown ceiling. Bourne is going to have big weeks and duds.

Demario Douglas is likely to get 1,000 yards this year, as he’s likely the best WR on the roster. There are far more useless sleepers than him in the same region of mock drafts.

Douglas on the other hand does have a shot at being the #1 target earner on his offense, in fact he was towards the end of the season last year. Now the patriots' offense was terrible and the target share wasn't elite, but if it manages to improve he might be a decent value (at 140+).
