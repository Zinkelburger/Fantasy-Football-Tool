Upsides:
    Elite Route Running: Washington is known for his precise route running and ability to create separation, making him a potential PPR asset if he finds a role.
    Missed Tackle Machine: He has a knack for making defenders miss, leading to additional yardage after the catch.

Downsides:
    Size Concerns: At 5'8", Washingtonâ€™s stature could limit his ability to succeed against larger, more physical NFL defenders.
    Uncertain Role: As an undrafted free agent, Washington faces an uphill battle to secure a significant role, making him a long shot for fantasy relevance.

Could be a good dart throw in the final rounds
