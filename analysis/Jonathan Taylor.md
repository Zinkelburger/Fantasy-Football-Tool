"During Taylor's first two seasons, there were no contract issues or significant injuries, and he was a top 6 RB in PPR both years, including one as RB1 Overall.  He's paid and healthy and should end up right back there again this season.  The Colts' offensive line is solid, and Taylor should have a clear path to being a legit RB1 this season.  Even when he was healthy last season, the contract issues seemed to slow him down with rust.  With limited alternatives in the Colts' backfield, Taylor is one of the few in a situation to be a bell cow."

"Jonathan Taylor - Centerpiece of a run-heavy offense. More stable role compared to other RBs in this range but I have concerns about pass catching."

Upside:

    Talent and Role: Taylor is one of the most talented running backs in the NFL. His 2021 season, where he led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns, showcases his high ceiling. If he stays healthy, Taylor has the potential to return to elite form.
    Volume: He is expected to be the primary back for the Indianapolis Colts, ensuring a significant share of carries and opportunities. This volume is critical for fantasy success, especially in standard leagues.
    Improved Offense: With Anthony Richardson set to start at quarterback, there is hope for a more dynamic offense that could open up more running lanes for Taylor.

Drawbacks/Concerns:

    Injury History: Taylor has struggled with injuries over the past two seasons, missing a significant number of games. This increases his risk and could limit his availability and effectiveness.
    Reduced Passing Game Role: Taylor's involvement in the passing game has decreased, especially with a mobile quarterback like Richardson who may not check down to running backs as often. This reduces his value, particularly in PPR formats.
    Touchdown Dependency: His standout 2021 season was bolstered by an unsustainable touchdown rate. It's uncertain if he can replicate such a performance, making his fantasy value somewhat reliant on scoring.

 Jonathan Taylor (No injuries, contract struggles, etc., could easily see him back as a top 5 RB) 

JT is a workhorse, they have no other RBs that will cut in to his playing time, he just got paid and they’re gonna get every dollar out of him, AR [Anthony Richardson- QB] got hurt like 4 times in 5 games last year so they aren’t gonna blast him up the middle at the goal line, AR could just get hurt again, etc

At 10 I’m picking JT, he’s 2 years removed from an 1800 yard season and played very well when he was on the field last year after the holdout and mysterious “injuries” 

Buying AR and Colts stock but his passing won’t be polished enough in what is essentially his rookie season to support Pittman, Downs, and AD. Think the play with this team is either AR + Pittman or just JT. Think owning anything besides those 3 is useless in redraft, coming from someone who loves Downs.

I’m not sure any team wants their franchise quarterback to be taking all of the goal line carries after he was just out for a full year due to being overly aggressive. They will opt to use JT when they can IMO, especially after paying him a ton of money
