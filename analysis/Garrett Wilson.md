"Huge upside. If Aaron Rodgers is 60-70% of what he was in green bay, Wilson will be curb stomping defenses all season long"

"Garrett Wilson - Has shown talent to jump into the upper echelon but never had any stability in the offense."

"Watching Garrett Wilson last year, there is no doubt in my mind he is genuinely an elite talent. Dude was open so much and just missed. With a competent QB I think he’ll be a top 10-12 WR for sure."

Garrett Wilson is poised for a significant fantasy football upside in the 2024 draft, mainly due to his exceptional talent and the potential stability provided by Aaron Rodgers at quarterback. In his rookie season, Wilson showcased his potential with 83 catches for 1,103 yards, although he only scored four touchdowns. His second year saw similar issues with poor quarterback play after Rodgers' injury, yet he still managed to display WR1 characteristics and a substantial 30.1% target share​ (FantasyPros)​​ (Pro Football Network)​.

Upside:

    Elite Talent: Wilson's ability to perform well regardless of subpar quarterback play underlines his WR1 potential. His route running, speed, and ability to create separation make him a standout receiver.
    Improved QB Situation: With a presumably healthy Aaron Rodgers, Wilson is expected to benefit from more accurate and consistent quarterback play, significantly boosting his fantasy value​ (Pro Football Network)​​ (https://www.fantasylife.com)​.
    High Target Share: Wilson's high target share and involvement in the Jets' offense suggest he will continue to be a focal point, providing ample opportunities to score points.

Drawbacks/Considerations:

    QB Health: Rodgers' health is a critical factor. If Rodgers faces any setbacks, Wilson's production might be hindered by the same issues as last season.
    Offensive Line and Supporting Cast: The performance of the Jets' offensive line and the overall offensive strategy will also impact Wilson's output. Inconsistent play from these units could limit his ceiling​ (https://www.fantasylife.com)

8. This years CD Lamb is Garret Wilson
It’s crazy to think but CD Lamb had never finished higher than WR7. 2022 he was WR7 at 17.7ppg. The year before he was a bit of a bust, WR21 on a ppg basis.
With Wilson, last year was his bust year. Understandable bc they lost Rodgers, but this year I think he has parallels to CD: a 2nd round pick, a known quantity that is not a sleeper and we fully expect WR1 numbers, but will surprise with THE WR1 numbers
