Jelani Woods (TE 29, ADP 246): Woods is a third year tight end on the ascending Indianapolis Colts. Woods is 6'7, 253 lbs, and has the second highest RAS of any tight end ever (if you're wondering Zach Kuntz, a second year tight end for the Jets has the highest score ever). Woods recorded 25 catches for 312 yards in his rookie year but missed his sophomore season due to injury but he returns to a Colts team that could potentially have a spot for their number two target. Pittman is the clear number one guy on this team but behind him there is Josh Downs and Adonai Mitchell. Woods hasn't shown much but he has a relatively easy group of tight ends to beat out between Mo Alie-Cox, Kylen Granson, and Will Mallory. Downs is the obvious favorite to be the number two guy on this team but Woods is worth a flier in deeper leagues.
