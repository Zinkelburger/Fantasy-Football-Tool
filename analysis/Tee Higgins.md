"Contract year Tee Higgins is going to be great"

"One down year and people forget how good Higgins really is. Back to back 1000 yard seasons with 6/7 TDs while missing multiple games both years. If he's healthy he's easily getting 1200+ yards and 8+ TDs"

"Agreed. Tee screwed me many times. They say he’s starting, comes out and gets one target, and then doesn’t see another one for the rest of the game. Also, betting on Higgins AND burrow to be fully healthy is risky"

"I got him in like the 6th round of my keeper league and I was freaking out about it lol. So hyped

He was literally going in the second round in redraft leagues last year…"

"I loved having tee on my team two years ago, but there’s no shot I’m drafting him this season. WR2 on his team that’s always seem to got some nagging injury with a quarterback that’s coming off an injury. No thanks"

"I’m strongly considering a duo of waddle and Higgins. Feels like I can get them super cheap in between the two of them at least have a month of both of them performing well."

Tee Higgins ever since that big fat zero a couple of years ago. 

He’s done that a couple times if I’m not mistaken.

Week one this past year lol. 8 targets for a goose egg

The offseason questions about Higgins left us hoping he would land somewhere he could establish himself as the WR1 for an offense. Unfortunately, fantasy managers will have to wait one more season for that. Higgins is the WR2 for a Joe Burrow-led offense. That is one of the criteria met already. Not only that, but with Tyler Boyd moving on and questions around who will fill the WR3 role for this team, Higgins, if he can stay healthy, should flirt with 125-135 targets. When it comes to his skillset and the things we care about, Higgins is great at attacking the ball in the air and winning contested catch situations. Last season, while he dealt with injury, his success rate did drop, but not to the point of being genuinely concerned about him as a player. He is primarily an outside receiver, and with Ja’Marr Chase’s increased usage in the slot and the shorter areas of the field, we could see some blow-up games from Higgins in 2024. You can draft him on the fringes of WR3 territory, and that is value worth capitalizing on.
