"Way too high/low - Puka/Kupp. Last year, when they shared the field, Puka only had 20% of the red zone targets whereas Kupp had 33%. Also, Kupp had a higher percentage of first read looks. This is even more exaggerated as Kupp was also not operating at 100% due to lingering hamstring and ankle injuries."
"Counterpoint, kupp hasn’t played a full season since 2021 and is 31 years old."
"Better than banking on a 31 year old WR with injury concerns and already showing signs of decline"

"It’s insane that the existence of Puka has made Kupp fall so much. Dont get me wrong, Puka is great but this is fucking Cooper Kupp we are talking about."

"At this point I’ve been saying screw it and stacking Puka and Kupp in some of my mocks, since I can usually pick him up at the 3/4 turn"

"Cooper Kupp - Has put up legendary seasons in the not-so-distant past but injuries might have caught up to him. I think Kupp has more to give and I buy the dip."

Same vein, but this year's keenan allen is cooper kupp. Both have rich injury history, but kupp's not the one injured right now. Much like keenan allen's was last year, kupp's wr cohort is injured.
i feel like we are going to look back at this season and think "why did we not draft kupp in the early 2nd?"

If that happens the most important factor will be that stafford made it another full season
