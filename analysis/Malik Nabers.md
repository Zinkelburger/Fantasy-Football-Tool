"Malik Nabers - If Harrison Jr is going so early, Nabers should be right behind him. There is value here as the Giants offense reeks but that should mean a huge target share."

"Malik Nabers looking like a WR1"

"Arguments I can see for him is hes a physical phenom, is easily the number one target in that wasteland of a WR room and would have gone first easy if not for Marvin. But it’s rare to see a first round receiver pay off that type of ADP. In the recent past guys I can think of that would have been worth that high of draft capital their rookie year are Jefferson, Chase, Waddle, and Puka. Difference is you got all of them cheaper in the draft (or on waivers for Puka), they all had FAR better QB play (sorry Danny Dimes truthers) and were on better offenses than the Giants are projected to be this year."

"Nabers will feast in garbage time and NYG will be playing a lot of garbage time this season."

"I was not in love with him at all, until today. Apparently Giants beat guys have been raving about him and that he’s the best rookie receiver they’ve seen in forever, including Odell.

He also apparently caught 16 of 17 targets in a joint camp practice against the Lions, so make of that what you will.

I have a strict no shitty QB policy for my receivers, but he is really fucking pushing it and if he falls in my lap, I might just pull the trigger."

"Really feels like daboll is going to run the whole offense through Nabers."

"Great catch, but I'd imagine that a lot of his targets are going to be contested just like in the video because they don't have much of an offense. Going to be a frustrating season. Reminds me of Garrett Wilson's situation as a rookie."

"I’ve said it a bunch but I think he’s going to be just like Garrett Wilson last year. Talent is there, will wow you occasionally… but the QB play and offense is so bad that he’s not a reliable weekly fantasy starter"

"I don’t know if you watched their preseason game today but the OL is totally revamped and looked good against the Houston first team. Jones had a horrid start but then put together a couple nice drives. The giants will surprise this season and be a competent offense."

"are we just ignoring the fact that Danny Nickels is his qb? guy hasnt thrown Dimes in years."

"It’s fine if you take him in rounds 4-6, closer to 6 than 4 for me personally, but I’d expect his production to look a lot like Drake London last year. Some great weeks, and a lot of 7-10 targets for 3/50 and a low number of TDs overall"

"Yeah true, Nabers is still going around guys like Tee, Zay, Rashee, all of who I’d just rather have than him. Once you get into Ridley territory or later than yeah I think he’s worth it"

"If Garrett Wilson was still a solid contributor with Rodgers out last year then Nabers should be the same even with Danny at QB.

So much room at his current ADP to find value in him."

"Nabers. As a giants fan and with all this camp hopium, I just see myself taking him in the fourth. 

I honestly think that's pretty good value. The upside is insane. 

He's going to be lathered in targets. It's not the worst idea."

Malik Nabers - Seems like he has the most buzz in the NFL camps right now. Making great catches, dominating targets and generally lifting the offence. I believe in the talent, and if the Giants understand that the entire offensive gameplan needs to be about how to get the ball to Nabers in space, I can see him well exceed expectations.
