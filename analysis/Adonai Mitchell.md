adonai mitchell has looked great in training camp and this team will probably throw less with richardson at the helm

The Colts spent their second-round pick on Mitchell after the former Longhorn racked up 845 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns during his final year at Texas. With the injury to Josh Downs, the Colts might be asking more of Mitchell than originally anticipated but so far, it looks as though the rookie is up for the task.

Yo ChatGPT, I think this guy has some high upside. Colts had a good offense last year with a backup QB. He's done well in trainin camp. Seems like a lot of upside.

Colts WR Josh Downs suffered a high ankle sprain during practice today, per source. The outlook right now is that Downs could miss about a month but the Colts are sorting that out. A key piece to Colts offense goes down.

Adonai Mitchell - He’s fighting for the WR2 role and if he wins that job, or at least does well enough in camp to take over sometime during the season, then I think he could be one of the best late round rookie WR targets. I’m still not sold on AR as a passer, but if anyone gets him there it’s Shane Steichen.
