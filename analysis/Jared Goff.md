 Personally if I'm stacking a late QB to pair with Goff, Jayden Daniels has an excellent schedule alongside him and would be my premiere choice-- The games Goff are away the matchups Washington has are relatively good, outside of Week 9 (Ravens.) 



The Lions only play 3 outdoor games in all of 2024, which is huge for Goff. He plays WAY better indoors.

Goff and the Lions are S Tier when they play indoors, buy as many Lions players as you can because they have the best roster in the NFL currently.

Nothing wrong with grabbing Goff especially in the offense they run. Grabbed him in the 8th and then grabbed Jayden in the 10th. Have a feeling I'll be starting Jayden over Goff at some point this season.
