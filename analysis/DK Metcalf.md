"DK Metcalf. Going as the WR 22 on sleeper. He’s been top 15 range just about every year other than his rookie year. WR 16 in half ppr. WR 21 in full ppr last season which is his lowest finish outside his rookie year. Don’t see him finishing at WR 22 or lower this season."

"DK Metcalf and Michael Pitmann are both prototypical X receivers that have questions on their roles in their offenses and overall situation. DK is a soft fade (questions on target competition and o-line)"

It’s bc DK is super boom or bust and frustrating to own. I’ve owned him a couple times in competitive leagues as a WR2 and he can go 1 reception for 40 yards with 0 TDs or 5+ for 100+ yards and 2 TDs but you never know when it’s gonna happen.

Just checked them. From weeks 1-4 he averaged about 14 points which is decent. But from weeks 6-13, he averaged about 15 points scoring 10, 11, 6, 16, 20, 6, and then 37 points in week 13. That is the definition of boom or bust for ME considering he went from a modest 10-11 points to a 6 point week followed by decent 16 and 20 points just to drop a 6 point week again. 

Bro he had 12 points or more in 14 games out of the 17 week fantasy season. It doesn't get much more consistent than that. Definitely not boom or bust.

You can catch a steal like DK or Kupp in round 4, or just go an entirely different way. Plenty of mid wrs later
