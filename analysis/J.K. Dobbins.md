Torn Achilles and multiple acl tears. Iâ€™m gonna be honest itâ€™s a no from me dog

My man is the captain of his own hype train this season, but not many people are getting on.

not touching him ever again in fantasy

Agree, you are drafting him late as a lottery ticket. If he doesn't pan out after a couple weeks you can move on.
