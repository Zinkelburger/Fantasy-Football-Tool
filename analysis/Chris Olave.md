"Carr can't find him when he's open which makes Olave frustrated and once frustrated Olave gives up on routes which makes Olave open less often.

Olave is a seriously talented player but as long as Carr is his QB I'm out on him."

"Every play I linked is an example of one of many of the same kind that were themes all last season. Carr is awful not just for Olave but for all the receivers. They were schemed open quite often but Carr constantly showed an inability to throw to them accurately, terrible moves in the pocket and play under pressure, and unwillingness to even execute the play by refusing to throw to his reads or looking away to go with the checkdown for minimal gain or a loss. I don't have the film for all of this but watching the plays and replays in real time it was just never-ending.

While Olave is a very talented player, the situation he's in isn't priced in to his value in the slightest. I don't see much reason to expect better numbers than last year with the same QB running the show. Kamara is the only player I want to draft at cost from this offense in any of my leagues this year."

"He'd be fine if his ADP was a round lower at least. 0 shot he belongs in the 2nd round. The targets are cool but Carr will still prefer to check it down or just miss Olave like he did all last season."

Agree with you on the WR fades. Especially Olave, he is in a situation where he could be wr1 but hasn’t broken through to that elite level. And he’s being drafted to be elite

Olave’s ADP being that high when the saints offense could be at their lowest point in the last decade amazes me
