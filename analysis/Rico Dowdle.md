"Zeke is going to infuriate those of you that take Dowdle/whoever we bring in. We needed Zeke back for two very obvious reasons - pass blocking and short yardage. Whatever the split ends up being, Zeke is going to see the field a ton on third downs and near the goal line.

I’m going way back now but I expect this to be similar to Julius Jones/Marion Barber. Julius saw nearly all the early down work between the 20s, and Barber handled the third downs and red zone touches.

To be clear I’m not saying don’t draft Dowdle, I think he’ll have value. I’m just saying Zeke is gonna play enough in those situations that it’s gonna drive people nuts."

"Anyone drafting dowdle is not hoping to get 75% snap shares including all passing and short yardage. You are taking dowdle hoping to get 60% and a split of short yardage and passing downs which is totally possible considering age and camp reports."

"Rico dowdle. Anything thinking zeke is anything for than veteran depth just like freedman is crazy. Dowdle has youth and explosiveness on his side. Dowdle is the only one in that backfield that could have any serious snap share advantage at the end of the day."

I think taking a shot on the lead back for the cowboys is worth a late round pick. Zeke is most likely washed, Dowdle has some burst, and their RB3 is currently Deuce Vaughn.

I think he’s gonna be on all of my ESPN teams. It’s a super low risk very high reward pick.

Don’t tell my league mates, but Rico Dowdle is basically undrafted on ESPN. So he’s my pick for that site specifically.
