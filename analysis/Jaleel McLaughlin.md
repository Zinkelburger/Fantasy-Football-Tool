Broncos RB snap count after 2 drives: Jaleel McLaughlin 11 (including 3rd and 9, and goal line snaps) Javonte Williams 9 - Out of 20 plays 

Javonte took 5 of the first 8 snaps, averaged 5.7 a tote, and scored a 15-yard receiving TD that got called back.

You mean at best? Javonte is capable of playing both roles. Jaleel is like sproles but more limited because he can’t run between the tackles. 
Jaleel averaged 5.4 yds per carry last season, he ain’t to shabby

McLaughlin is a beast. He’s like the new phillip lindsay

I wouldn’t worry - Javonte and Jaleel basically matched targets and carries (both had 3 rushes for 17 yards, Javonte just had more receiving yards) with Javonte also having a receiving touchdown called back due to penalty. I think he’ll be a fine rb3/spot starter/flex as needed.

Jaleel is the guy here. Peyton loves to scheme up screens and short passes to rbs especially when down on the score board and that’s jaleels game. Either way avoid this backfield lol

Oregon fan here: this is great for broncos RBs. Nix is not a risk taker and loves to check it down, and Payton loves to throw the ball to RBs. I really like Javonte and McLaughlin this year and will be taking a lot of late round swings at the Denver backfield

I'm aiming to get McLaughlin in every league. Hardly any draft capital, but I think he's gonna be regularly useful. Hard to lose on a pick that late anyway, even if he's nothing.
