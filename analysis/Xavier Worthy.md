Rice isn't suspended yet, so Worthy isn't guaranteed anything. We've also seen plenty of situations where the Chiefs WR aren't fantasy relevant/reliable, even if they're tied to Patrick Mahomes. I think there were concerns about Worthy's college production profile as well. 

Worthy still suffers from Mahomes spreading out the ball too much syndrome. 

Xavier Worthy might be trendier, but I think he'll fall into the classic Kansas City rookie WR trap where he'll start slow or Andy Reid would be very loathe to utilize him early. He'd maybe be an interesting "hold for later weeks" play, but I don't imagine him popping off early.
