"Jerry Jeudy - Going to be good this year after the Browns investment in going more spread offense for a solidified role in the slot."

Jerry Jeudy. Feel like people have been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt for years now
Are people still giving him a chance this season???
Theyâ€™re not. His ADP is among the most in dropped amount from this season vs last. As someone who has faded Jeudy since his rookie season, I love him this year for that reason.
His ADP in 0.5 PPR is as WR57. I think its safe to say that a lot of people are out on him.
