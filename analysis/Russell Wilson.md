[note he is now on the Steelers with Arthur Smith as OC]
Steelers QB Russell Wilson missed his second straight day of practice Friday because of injury. HC Mike Tomlin downplayed what's being reported as "calf tightness," saying the team wants "to keep a minor thing from becoming major."

Russ said he would have practiced today itâ€™s tomlin making him take it easy. Nothing to worry about
I agree. Worth noting, though, with plenty of lingering calf situations over the past couple of years.

Watching Russell Wilson stall out drives for 3/4 of every game the past two years has been so painful. I fully expect Bo Nix to at minimum increase the opportunities for most Broncos players to get stats. 

Russell Wilson had 3070 yards, 26 (+3 rush) touchdowns, and 8 interceptions. (98.0 passer rating)

This would be among the greatest rookie seasons in history. If you expect rookie Bo Nix to come in and be better than Russ was last year you are very likely to be sorely disappointed.
3070 yards is nothing. Russ made 3 great throws every game and did fuck all the rest of the game. Like the guy you responded to said, Bo Nix will easily eclipse 3k yards by not ending up in 3rd and longs every other drive, which will greatly increase the floor of every Bronco

You compare to Pickens. Pickens is flashy but has he shown you to be worthy of a volume role in the offense? Do you like anything you've really seen from Russ lately in terms of how he gets the ball to his weapons?
