Jermain Burton (Bengals), but he's gonna be fighting for targets behind Chase and Higgins.

I love Burton too stepping into the Boyd role but he is more of a dynasty pick when Higgins leaves next year.

“Once he gets the offense down pat, guys are going to realize he’s a problem.” Tee Higgins on rookie Jermaine Burton

Don't think he'll carve out a significant role this season unless an injury happens to Chase or Tee. However, in Dynasty I would buy this guy everywhere. Next year Tee will be gone and Burton could be a real problem in fantasy.

By significant you mean boom or bust flex play. I just can't see being able to rely on a rookie who's in a room with Chase and Tee Higgins being significant. Maybe he can be a flex play if you're truly desperate but I wouldn't define that as significant in my book. I look at significant as a WR2 at least. But let's not play semantics, i'll rephrase. He won't carve out a league winning role in that offense unless there's injury. He can provide you some flex weeks but that's about it.
