As a Cards fan, this dude has been the talk of the camp. There’s a reason why he’s starting. He’s worth an add for sure. He slid in the 3rd round due to his injury history. I think he would have went higher if not for that.

100% talented rookie, earning targets, teams better than expected, kyler coming back eventually. def worth an add

Michael Wilson - AZ McBride and Harrison getting a lot of attention Seeing a big uptake for Wilson in the red zone.

Keep an eye Michael Wilson! If Kyler stays healthy I do think this guy can be a great pick up anywhere past the 10th round
