"Number 3 running back in PPR totals last season and he’s going in the 3rd/4th round???? What? Etienne hasn’t missed a game since 2021 and was the focal point of the Jaguars offense earning a career year. Yes, I know Kirk will be coming back, along with Davis and Thomas but I still expect the Jags to lean heavily on Etienne due to his efficiency with the ball and receiving potential. He exudes health and consistency since his rookie year and it would be foolish to expect anything other than a top ten season, barring injury. In addition, he has the upside to be a top-five performer, in all of fantasy. "
