Upsides:
    Rising Rookie: Whittington has shown flashes during the preseason, catching the eye of many as a potential sleeper in the Rams' offense.
    High Volume Potential: If he continues to perform well, Whittington could see a significant number of targets in a pass-heavy Rams offense.

Downsides:
    Depth Chart Challenges: The Rams have several established receivers ahead of Whittington, which could limit his opportunities in the regular season.
    Inconsistency Risk: While heâ€™s shown promise, his role is not yet secure, making him a risky fantasy pick.

Could be a good dart throw in the final rounds
