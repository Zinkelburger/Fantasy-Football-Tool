"Caleb is a sneaky rushing qb with arguably top 5 offense(on paper). I think he’s got a higher ceiling than Purdy but his floor might not be as stable as purdy’s."

"It's possible. Bears actually had a solid defense towards the end of the year, especially when Sweat came over. Caleb probably has one of the best supporting casts for a first overall pick. Really excited to watch him play either way."

"Williams is more like a Mahomes, he’s athletic enough to get gains with his feet scrambling but it’s not his first plan of attack and the offence will be centered around his ability to throw."
