"Zach Charbonnet. He’s being drafted as the RB42 on Underdog.

He was a better prospect than every rookie RB this year, there’s a new fast paced offensive coordinator coming in, Pete Carrol probably underutilized him last year because he was a rookie, and if Kenneth Walker goes down he’s at least a top 10 RB."
