"The only high upside guy I don’t want to miss in the middle rounds is kincaid"

"For those reasons alone, I would rather draft someone with a clearer path to target dominance like Kincaid for example."

"Buffalo Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid has every opportunity to break out in Year 2. After the Bills traded away Stefon Diggs and lost Gabe Davis in free agency, Kincaid could emerge as Josh Allen's top pass-catcher in the receiving game in 2024.

Fantasy managers saw glimpses of Kincaid's potential last season, as he averaged a solid 9.4 PPR fantasy points per game. But the sky is the limit for the 24-year-old on a top offense in 2024. A 1,000-yard campaign is certainly not out of the question for him, especially on a team lacking wide receivers. That makes him a smash pick in the middle round of fantasy drafts." The only TE name I am really out on at ADP right now is Kincaid. His snap shares last year when they changed OC show me that his Brady sees gaps in Kincaid's game and that Knox will continue to have a 40-50% snap share role in the offense. Additionally while Diggs and Davis vacate a lot of targets I think people underestimate Curtis Samuel who had his best years under Joe Brady. Additionally, Shakir is coming off an insanely efficient year and likely earned himself additional looks this season. Finally Coleman will get his opportunities as a 2nd round rookie. Basically, I don't think Kincaid is going to jump from 90 targets to 150 like some people seem to believe. 

Kincaid in my mind has #1 potential at fair cost. I also think he has a high floor.  Josh Allen likes his tight ends in the end zone. 

I like Kincaid. I think his ceiling is high too without Diggs and Gabe Davis, he’s the WR2 with chemistry besides ShakirA

If you ask most Bills fans and reporters, the consensus is that Kincaid will get the most targets of any of our pass-catchers this season. I don't think we have a true WR1 this season and I can see Shakir, Samuel and Coleman all within 20-30 targets of one another in the high double digits. I would have put Coleman lower but he's lining up everywhere on the field and catching damn near everything in camp, and he's only been out there with the first team offense the entire time. He's been good for one crazy highlight every day so far. Given how this coaching staff tends to ease in rookies in skill positions, it's interesting to see them already putting this much faith in him. Shakir would have to double his amount of targets that he had last regular season to get to 90, although he only had 5 targets in the first 6 games so just utilizing him consistently throughout a full season will get him halfway there.
