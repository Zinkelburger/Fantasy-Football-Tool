I think Mattison is going to play and they’re going to play someone else on 3rd downs. I don’t buy him at his ADP at all.

The Raiders like to use Mattison and even their rookie RB on passing downs. They even got the tight end Bowers lining up at RB.

Through two games in the preseason, Mattison has carried the ball eight times for 30 yards, has one reception for six yards and has a kickoff return for 23 yards.

Last season, Mattison had career highs in rushing and receiving yards, accounting for 892 total yards throughout the 16 games he saw action in.
