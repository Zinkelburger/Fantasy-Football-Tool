I don’t always handcuff, I actually love drafting *other managers’*handcuffs for variety. Better chances of hitting, even multiple hits.
But if I have CMC this season, Jordan Mason becomes very important especially if called upon in that system. As you know, CMC did have 417 touches including playoffs last year and is already dealing with a calf strain… 

[Elijah Mitchell] already hurt and was so bad last year

Upsides:
    Clear Path to RB2 Role: With Elijah Mitchell frequently injured (currently dealing with a hamstring issue), Mason has a strong opportunity to secure the RB2 spot behind Christian McCaffrey. In preseason games, Mason started and performed well when given the chance.
    Power Running Style: Mason’s tough, physical running style fits well within the 49ers' scheme, and he has shown he can handle a heavy workload if needed.

Downsides:
    Specific Competition: Mason’s primary competition for the RB2 role is Elijah Mitchell, who, when healthy, has been effective. Additionally, Ty Davis-Price, another physical runner, could also be vying for touches, making Mason's grip on the backup role less certain if Mitchell returns healthy
    Limited Upside in Passing Game: With McCaffrey being one of the best pass-catching backs in the league, Mason is unlikely to see much work on passing downs, limiting his fantasy upside to early downs and goal-line carries.
