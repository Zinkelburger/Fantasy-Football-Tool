Kyren Williams, the Los Angeles Rams' running back, enters the 2024 fantasy football season with a solid upside and some notable considerations. Coming off a breakout season where he rushed for nearly 1,200 yards and scored 12 touchdowns in just 12 games, Williams is poised to be a key player in the Rams' offense. He was the RB6 in fantasy points per game last year, averaging 19.9 points per game despite missing five games. This performance indicates his high potential for fantasy managers, especially in standard scoring leagues​ (FantasyData)​​ (FantasyPros)​.

However, there are a few drawbacks to keep in mind. Williams has a history of injuries, including a recent foot issue that kept him out of some offseason activities. Additionally, the Rams drafted Blake Corum, a talented running back, which could lead to a split backfield if Williams struggles or gets injured again​ (FantasyData)​​ (Fantasy Football Calculator)​. His pass-game usage has also been limited, ranking 18th in target share and 58th in yards per route run among qualifying backs, suggesting he might not be as valuable in PPR formats​ (FantasyPros)​.

Overall, Kyren Williams has an upside due to his high volume and efficiency when healthy. However, the potential for injury and competition from Corum could impact his consistency. For a standard fantasy football league, Williams' draft score would be around 85 out of 100, considering both his potential and the risks involved.

"Kyren Williams is the only guy in the Henry, Etienne, Pacheco tier that could make sense this early."

Ok, I just can’t the Kyren Williams disrespect anymore. This dude is a legit RB. His vision is far above average, his ability to set up blocks is amazing. He does lack top end speed but consistently picks up large chunks. Just don’t expect 60 yard runs.  

 He is also a capable pass catcher who is involved in the pass game. He is a great blocker meaning there is literally no reason to take him off the field at any point, save for rest. 

 He plays in a high powered offense which is designed to get him excellent looks. No one faced fewer lighter boxes last year than Kyren. It’s because the Rams constantly run 3 WR sets. However, the WRs are so enthusiastic about run blocking that this becomes an advantage in the running game rather than a detriment. 

 Sean Mcvay loves the fucking guy. One of the best offensive minds in the league loves this guy. 

 Oh how about the Rams commitment to the run game? Not only in offensive schemes and the strong desire to run it in the red-zone; but their entire offseason strategy for the offense was to strengthen their offensive line. 

 Mind you, this was the #2 RB in the league last year while missing 4 games. Injuries are his one legitimate concern. If Corrum can spell Kyren effectively and reduce his injury risk while eating roughly 25-30% of the carries than tell me how that is worse?  

 My point may not have been clear. Even if you factor a 25% loss in snaps, keeping Kyren fresher might increase his stats, but at least be comparable to 4 games missed.  

Great offense? Check.   Goal-line carries? Check.  Passing work? Check.  Recent production?  Check. Opportunities?  Check. Age?  Check.   Injury concern? Name me a fucking RB who doesn’t. This is a top 5 RB. 

I wouldn’t be so sure about the goal line work considering how good Corum is at it.

While it’s true every RB is injury prone to an extent, Kyren has a history of lower body injuries specifically and a re-occurring ankle issue. Hes a huge risk.

Also if you are projecting Kyren to lose up to 25-30% of his workload from last year like you said, then he won’t be worth his current price.

Kyren has pretty much every red flag you should be looking to avoid in the first 1-2 rounds. Injuries, new competition, possible loss of goal line work. Not saying he’s a locked in bust but I can’t bring myself to look at him until the 3rd
