"Diontae . Understand new team, but draft every year as a solid floor fill in on my bye weeks."

"I think Diontae Johnson is going to get a fuck load of targets this year and could be a PPR WR1 (top 12) if he can find the end zone some."

"he’s definitely our WR1. Him and Bryce have already seemingly established a nice connection, and we know that when the Panthers want to feed the ball to someone, Bryce can feed them the ball. Look at Thielen"

"hes a steal at round 8, WR1 Carolina"

"Diontae Johnson - Earns targets at an elite rate and is a true alpha that is incredibly underrated. We saw how Thielen started the year and I believe there is a void in this room for a true alpha target that will flourish even with a struggling QB."

"Diontae Johnson, despite being on what could be the leagues worst offense again. 

Adam theilen was like top 10 for a while. Panthers got help on their oline and he’ll probably get fed on targets to start the year. I’m taking him if he’s the best around his ADP when I draft. I’ve been thinking the same thing lately too. I got torched by Thielen last year and I feel like Diontae still has more juice, he’s not even expensive either. Feels like it’s worth a shot."

"Well worth a bench spot this season. Cheap AF. May not necessarily be utilized in the same way he was in Pittsburgh -- a good thing -- and there are a number of reasons to expect improvement from the Panthers."
