Pierce was such a bust that he’s just completely forgotten about on most people’s “busts” lists lmao

Yeah, I’m not falling for the Pierce trap again. He was good his rookie year, but Houston doesn’t have confidence in him.

Pierce doesn't really fit into the new run scheme. Mixon probably sees the majority of the real work

It’ll be mixon all day everyday. Unless you need a big game from mixon, that’ll be the time for pierce to get all the work.
