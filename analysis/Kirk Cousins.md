"Falcons - Zac Robinson comes from the McVay tree and will make the passing game a focal point of the offense. Cousins is the best QB Atlanta has had since 2018 Matt Ryan. All three of London, Pitts, and Bijan should have huge years."

" Last year Kirk Cousins played with JJ, Jordan Addison, and TJ Hockenson. Each of those positions is a colossal step down in Atlanta, and also Kirk is coming off an Achilles injury. Why would he be better? Because they have a good RB? Because Zac Robinson is a big upgrade from (checking my notes here)…Kevin O’Connell? You’re talking about a new QB in a new system going from a top-5 supporting cast to a bottom-half supporting cast. If anything he’s wildly overvalued, it’s hard to imagine how he can even repeat his level of play in Minnesota."
