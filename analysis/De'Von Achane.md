"While he will be volatile, Achane is so explosive that even with limited action, he could still be effective.  While we're not expecting him to be as efficient as he was in his rookie year, he should get more work than last season.  Let's also not overreact to the addition of Jaylen Wright in the fourth round of this past draft. The Dolphins will use Wright to start pivoting off 32-year-old Raheem Mostert.  Achane is involved in the passing game, averaging over three targets per game when he was healthy.  Another advantage of Achane's significant play upside is he can always break it for a touchdown without needing to be in the RedZone.  There are barely any more bell-cow running backs, so a player with upside is what you should target, and no one has more of it than Achane.  If he expands his role, you have an elite fantasy option."

"Achane, not doubting his talent and big play ability. Durability concerns and the fact he isn’t the biggest guy makes me think he won’t get a lot of the goal line carries. If was going in the 3rd or 4th maybe but a 2nd is too rich for me."

"Devon Achane - You're in or you're out. I play fantasy football to win it all, go big or go home, and Achane is the biggest test of faith we've had in years."

"Achane's ADP seemed crazy bullish, until last night when I went on a highlight binge.

My erection has not subsided.

I'm in."

"Achane is such a tough one cause I could see him being a bust with where he’s going, but imagine he gets a decent workload? He could be a fantasy monster."

Upside:
De'Von Achane demonstrated exceptional efficiency and explosive playmaking ability during his rookie season with the Miami Dolphins. He posted an impressive 7.8 yards per carry and scored 11 touchdowns, showcasing his potential as a game-changer in fantasy football. His skill set includes elite speed, agility, and improving receiving skills, making him a versatile threat both on the ground and through the air​ (FantasyPros)​​ (Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues)​. Achane operates in one of the league's most dynamic offenses, and even with limited touches, he has the potential to produce significant fantasy points, particularly in big-play situations​ (Pro Football Network)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:
Achane's main concerns revolve around his workload and durability. Standing at 5'9" and 188 pounds, he is not built for a traditional workhorse role and is unlikely to receive high-volume carries consistently. Additionally, the presence of Raheem Mostert and the possibility of a running back committee approach may limit his touches. Achane's explosive but volatile performance pattern can lead to some inconsistent fantasy outputs, which might be frustrating for managers looking for steady production​ (Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues)​​ (FantasyOwner.com)​.

Also, you could add 16 if you can stomach De'Von Achane's volatile nature. The highly varying opinions that he could be the RB1 overall week-to-week or that he will be injured after 5 plays are both accurate, so take that for what you will.
