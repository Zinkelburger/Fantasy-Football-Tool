If he's the back he'll be good, but he has competion.

Javonte took 5 of the first 8 snaps, averaged 5.7 a tote, and scored a 15-yard receiving TD that got called back. 

Thank you for adding this - was going to mention Javonte looks a lot better another year off destroying his knee. McLaughlin will still be a factor, but this will likely be a Kamara/ingram-like split at worst.

You mean at best? Javonte is capable of playing both roles. Jaleel is like sproles but more limited because he can’t run between the tackles.

I wouldn’t worry - Javonte and Jaleel basically matched targets and carries (both had 3 rushes for 17 yards, Javonte just had more receiving yards) with Javonte also having a receiving touchdown called back due to penalty. I think he’ll be a fine rb3/spot starter/flex as needed.

Oregon fan here: this is great for broncos RBs. Nix is not a risk taker and loves to check it down, and Payton loves to throw the ball to RBs. I really like Javonte and McLaughlin this year and will be taking a lot of late round swings at the Denver backfield

Broncos players have all been going after pick 100…if [the rookie QB] can even be slightly below average guys like Sutton and Javonte will smash their ADP

The DEN backfield is the most confusing backfield I've ever seen but yet, I still think Javonte is worth a shot at 95.

his ADP seems pretty right - if he's back to being good two years after the injury, he's a great value... but there's definitely a lot of baked in risk that he's in a split backfield with Jaleel (and others?) in a not-so-good offense
love taking him there but would not want to count on him at all

As a Broncos fan, it looks like the team won’t be keeping Perine so Javonte could have an expanded role in rushing and receiving. He also has looked better now that he’s more than a year removed from his knee injury.
Having said that, this will still be a committee with Estime and Jahleel being involved
