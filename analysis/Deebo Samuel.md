Deebo Samuel is a versatile weapon in the 49ers' offense, capable of producing big plays both as a receiver and a runner. His unique role in the offense makes him a high-upside fantasy asset. However, his production may be inconsistent due to the presence of other playmakers like Christian McCaffrey and Brandon Aiyuk, and he has a history of injuries that could be a concern. 

Just wondering what players are on your DO NOT draft list and why, For me it’s Deebo Samuel going around picks 22-30 on Yahoo. He has never played a full season, and if you draft him that high he is obviously a cornerstone player of your team.. but to miss atleast 3-4 games each year guaranteed is just a no for me, i love the player and he is awesome but too risky going early 3rd round ( in Yahoo ) when there is better WR options out there. 

NFL is a violent game. Everyone is an injury risk, only about 2.3% of players will not miss time with injury. People who are confident about who will miss time and who won't are often wrong - the great JT/CMC debates of 2022 should have cemented that in everyone's brains.

But folks who pass on high upside players because they're sure of injury just create better values for the rest of us. Deebo, Achane, Richardson. Give me all of them. 

100% correct. I’m buying all the Deebo I can rn since the risk is now baked in taking him at the 3-4 turn vs the early-mid 2nd…

I have grown to like Deebo more than Aiyuk, but there are so many pieces to this puzzle that are interesting to dissect.
What happens if Aiyuk is out but everyone else is healthy (I think last year this happened once and Deebo was very good, TNF against NYG I think)?

I’m scared of Deebo with his injury history and how he runs and lack of purdy passing volume. However if I’m picking a WR I feel like he’s the best of all round 3 recievers… 

Last year Aiyuk's ADOT was 13.8.
Deebo's was 6.6.
I honestly flip a coin if they're both available.
