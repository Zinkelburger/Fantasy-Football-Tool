"The other Chargers' backs are familiar with the system but aren't outstanding players in Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins.  This regime drafted Vidal, a powerful rusher who fits what the staff intends to do.  If he gets a hold of the starting job, he may not let it go, and this offense wants to run, run, and run some more.  Justin Herbert is a talented enough passer to keep the defense honest, but Vidal could be a bruiser if he gets to the top of the depth chart."

Unfortunately he hasnt gotten any hype or positives really. Im an owner too but when Spiller has more praise than him it doesnt look good. It’s a good thing though. That’s how you get steals in the fantasy draft.
