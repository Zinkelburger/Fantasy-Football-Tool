Injured last year, but was very good when he wasn't. New center, may look to run the ball a lot more.

"RB: Aaron Jones (RB20) is someone I cannot blame anyone for fading. But I am going to look past last year’s injuries and think about the situation. It’s him and Ty Chandler. Kevin O’Connell ran a high volume passing offense with Cousins, but his QB is now Darnold or a rookie. They will likely run more, and if they don’t, Jones is a strong pass-catching back. Also, I believe in revenge games, and he gets two."

"somehow every year Aaron Jones end up on my team even though I tell myself to stay away before the draft."

"He's on the Vikings now so they will actually hand him the ball unlike the GB (butt)Packers.

So the question is will he be Cook or will he be Alexander?"

"KOC has run the ball about 340 times among his top backs each of the last 2 years as Vikings HC. If we assume Ty Chandler gets 100 carries again that's 240 for Jones. No other back on the team had more than 5 last year (and no RB, Including Chandler, had more than 10 carries in 2022 all of which were in the league, 3 of which were on the VIkings).

Darvin Cook had 260 carries in 2022, so is Jones gonna be more like Cook or is he more like Mattison (180 carries)? Even if he is more toward Mattison's number when Jones has gotten 200+ carries he has gotten 1000+ yards."

"Aaron Jones. He's going to be RB1 + WR2 until Hockenson and Addison (maybe suspension) come back"

He’s talented but he is getting older, the Vikings don’t have good IOL, this team didn’t have good rushing production last year and they’re not expected to have as good of a record.

He looked like an RB1 when healthy last season. I think the bigger concern if he can stay healthy.
