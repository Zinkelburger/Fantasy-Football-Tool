Kansas City Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire (illness) remains the favorite for second-string duties behind Isiah Pacheco, but the former first-rounder hasn't been on the field much of late in training camp while he deals with ongoing struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder, primarily stemming from what he describes as a "self-defense situation" in 2018. "But it's real, real bad dehydration, dropping weight real fast, but it's really just mentally, just not being there," Edwards-Helaire said. Head coach Andy Reid admitted it's a sensitive situation, but he wouldn't go as far as to say CEH was a candidate to start the regular season on Injure Reserve.
