Slayton can run like maybe 3 routes at an elite level. He improved on this a bit last year but that's still his biggest limitation. His hands is also not exactly great for a #1 WR. Slayton is the guy who you generally hope to be maybe your team's 3rd best WR and you would have an elite WR room. But given how bad the Giants have been at drafting WRs in the last decade he sort of stumbled into the WR1 role by default.

I took over a fantasy team that was 1-6 during Slayton's "breakout year". Picked up Slayton and almost made the playoffs. I don't like doing team names based off player names, but HAIL SLAYTON was just too good a name to pass up.
Golladay killed all my Slayton excitement the next year. They keep trying to bury him on the depth chart, but he always starts to rise back up.

Now the Giants have Malik Nabers who was drafted in round 1 (presumably to be the WR1). Even when Slayton was the WR1 in 2023, he didn't produce much. And that role was by accident, 
He was almost cut beginning of 2023 and took a pay cut to remain on the team was like WR5 by the end of the year he was WR1 again lmao. 
Yup, he barely made the 53 but was pushed into the WR1 role because we lost:
Toney, injury/trade Golladay, injury Wanâ€™Dale, injury Shepard, injury Colin Johnson, injury
