Baker is a fourth-round pick out of UCF. He was initially at the University of Alabama before struggling to find playing time. The move proved to be a good one, as Baker posted just under 2,000 receiving yards in his final two seasons. The good news for Baker is that he has a chance to be the Patriotsâ€™ X-receiver of the future. My projections have the Patriots wide receiver room shaping up with Baker, Polk, and Demario Douglas leading the way. If that were to be the case, Baker should contend for 135 targets in his rookie season and be the opportunity-juiced version of Dontayvion Wicks from a year ago.

Do you really want to draft a patriot? The above blurb has him at ADP 250. Maybe a super deep sleeper if the Patriots are magically good.
