"I think his ADP everywhere will steam up to around 100 overall to 120 honestly by August. Underdog drafters value him as a 100 overall calibur player in the Jonathan Brooks range but well see where his true value will lie"

Brock Bowers (TE 12, ADP 108): First up we have Brock Bowers, the 13th pick out of Georgia. Bowers was a 3 year starter at Georgia and was a two time Mackey award winner for the best tight end in college football. On the Raiders, he will be in competition for the number target with Jakobi Meyers and could lose snaps to last years second round pick Michael Mayer. Bowers is an elite athlete who could command a heavy target share from the beginning. Many of his issues stem from the QB play in Las Vegas (O'Connell and Minshew) and what projects to be a pretty lackluster offense. Low volume and target competition from the other receivers on the team could be major forces against Bowers.

If Bowers is a punt, then i don’t want to know my drafting strategy is called. He’s the last of the tier I want before I truly punt for Mike Gesicki lol

Bowers is a tough one for me. I love the talent, but I hate the situation. He's on a team with lots of competition for targets, will split snaps with the other 1st round pick TE, they don't have a good QB, and I don't trust the offensive play caller in Luke Getsy.
