DJ Moore played 18 games with Darnold in Carolina and produced 89 catches for 1,234 yards and 7 TDs according to StatMuse. I agree he's the worst QB of the ones you listed. I think drafting Jefferson at his ADP is a bet on his talent plus Kevin O'Connell's coaching.

I’d say Sam Darnold is better than Mullens and Dobbs.

He put up 503 yards in 5 games coming back from an injury with those two last year. These are for 17 game paces so take it accordingly for your league.

That’s a pace of 108 Receptions for 1710 Yards and 6 TDs. I’d expect similar receptions, 200-300 less yards and 6-10 TDs. That’s roughly 225 0.5 PPR points. Or WR 8 last year.

Darnold is closer to 190 passing yards per game as a starter across 56 starts.  Now this offense is better, but we don’t have evidence yet that he can pull off a high yardage season.
