 Kind of sad to see but reports have been brutal on JuJu Smith-Schuster. Sounds like he's closer to not making the team at all than he is to having a meaningful role. Which says a lot given the uncertainty in that WR room. It's not like he's competing with Nico, Diggs, and Tank Dell or something there - Pop Douglas and Kendrick Bourne haven't even suited up yet so it's basically rookies and KJ Osborn out there.
