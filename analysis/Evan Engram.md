"Engram is TE4 over the last 2 seasons, I’m perfectly fine grabbing him as the ~8th TE."

"TE: Evan Engram (TE7) is proof we never learn. Two top five finishes in a row, including TE2 last season in half PPR. I’m not worried about Gabe Davis, honestly, and Christian Kirk is a reliable presence, but not a stud WR1 by any means. There is room for Brian Thomas Jr to take a role and still leave 7-8 targets per game for Engram’s volume-heavy role."

Evan Engram I think is being very underrated. He led all TE's in targets last year with 143 and the team lost Calvin Ridley who had 136. Those targets will be divided between Brian Thomas Jr, Christian Kirk, and Engram, but I think Engram is in line to feast once again this year.

If I can get Evan Engram as late as he’s going, why would I play a guessing game on who the TE1 and TE2 will be in Rounds 2-4?
