Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver DJ Chark left practice early after grabbing his left hip flexor. He came up limping after opening play of 11 on 11 in practice. Last season, Chark played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, posting 35 catches for 525 yards and five touchdowns over 15 games.

The veteran wide receiver had a snap count of 29 for the Bolts this weekend against the Los Angeles Rams. He took one carry on the ground for three yards but wasn't targeted at all throughout his time on the field.

With the Chargers' overall lack of experience at the wide receiver position entering the season, Chark has been expected to be the veteran voice. If he is out due to injury, Los Angeles will need others to heavily step up their games.

The Chargers traded away star wide receiver Keenan Allen this offseason, as well as let go of Mike Williams. This was part of a complete restructure of the wide receiver room to cut salary costs once the offseason started.

Los Angeles drafted rookie wide-out Ladd McConkey out of Georgia and has second-year wide receiver Quentin Johnston to fall back on. Chark helped round things out for the Bolts, especially with the ongoing struggles of Johnston.

Johnston only had one catch for 19 yards in the Bolts' preseason game against the Rams over the weekend. He had a snap count of 21 for the game overall.

The last thing the Chargers need is Chark to miss time. Quarterback Justin Herbert is already out after suffering a plantar fascia injury in his right foot. However, Herbert was seen practicing on Monday, a sign that he is making progress in the injury recovery.

DJ Chark - could potentially step into the Mike Williams role. Better redzone target than Joshua Palmer. We’ve seen him get 1k/8 TD’s with Minshew. Even if Ladd gets the most targets, he won’t soak up the same volume as Keenan. If Herbert gets back to 31 or 38 TD’s and 4k/5k yards (2020 & 2021), where is it all going?

I feel like Chark is a blast from the past. Seems a bit risky to assume it’s 2020 again. He seems like one of those guys you trot out when you’re down big in the hope that he can catch a 70 yard bomb and get 15 points on 1 catch.
