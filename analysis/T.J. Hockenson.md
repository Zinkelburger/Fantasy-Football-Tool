"I think once healthy Hockenson can be the TE3-5. The TE3-5 range is pick 46-51. Hockenson is going at pick 111.

I think saving 5 rounds of value to give up 5 weeks of production is a steal. Pairing him with a late TE like Freiermuth can keep you afloat at the position until Hockenson is back.

In exchange for those 5 weeks that you have to play Freiermuth instead of a top 5 TE you can get a WR like Tank Dell, George Pickens, or Amari Cooper. Those guys all have a shot at cracking WR1 numbers."

As a Vikings fan I'd advise against this. Missing time, pretty gnarly injury, coming back to a bad team with a carousel of QBs.

Just not worth the pick and stash (unless you can put him in an IR spot)

The hope of drafting Hock is that you can get elite TE production in the second half of the season

Are people really targeting Hockenson in drafts? He could miss half the season, and then is going to be working his way back from a torn ACL in a crowded offense with Sam Darnold at QB. I want no part of that headache.

My thinking is that for a super late ADP Iâ€™ll take a bet on him. That will potentially give me a top 3 TE for 10 weeks of the season. At his ADP there are not many higher upside options.

Top 3 TE is a stretch. Top 10 is more like it, especially coming off injury in a shitty qb situation. Was
