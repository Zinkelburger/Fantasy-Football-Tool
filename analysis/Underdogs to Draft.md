 Right now I really like:

-Mostert round 6

-rachee rice round 7

-Brock bowers round 13

-Gus Edwards round 10

-Josh Palmer round 10

-khalil shakir round 12

-Josh downs isnâ€™t being drafted (hes a starter for the colts)

QB - Jayden Daniels (#12 QB)

RB - Pacheco (#11 RB)

WR - Kirk (#30 WR)

TE - Ferguson (#9 TE) 

"The picks: 2 RB (Jahmyr Gibbs + Devon Achane) or 1 RB + 1 WR (AJB, Puka, Wilson)"

"What I recommend is pay attention to individual team depth charts and camp reports. That's really where you find the gems that win you the league. Look for rookie and 2/3rd year guys that have a path to a lot of touches/targets. This is where you find guys like Puka Nacua or Pacheco a few years before. Anywhere you have a low quality starter and there a young rookie turning heads in camp, take note. They might be worth a late flyer or an early waiver stash."
