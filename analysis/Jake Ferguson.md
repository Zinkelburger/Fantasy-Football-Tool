"Ferguson is a big sleeper cell imo. I'll take him at least a round ahead of ADP depending on how the other TEs are getting plucked. Among the highest in the league in Red zone targets and now Pollard is gone and Brandin Cooks is another year older. he's going to get work. Fully expect him to be #2 target in a good offense with high scoring upside in a division with bad secondaries"

"Ferguson is my entire strategy. Every egg, one basket."

"Jake Ferguson will be a top 8 TE this year and is going in late rounds. Iâ€™m going with him this year."

Yes heâ€™s projected a top 8-10 TE in ppr, but is there top 3 upside?

    102 targets last year

    120+ targets vacated from Pollard & Gallup

    Running game likely to struggle with an older zeke + dowdle and freeman

    Ceedee still isnâ€™t in camp

    10 catches, 93 yards, 3 TDs in the playoff game vs Packers

5 of those catches and two of those TDs after they already fell behind 48-16 in the 4th quarter lol

Also, the Packers kept playing zone and left him wide open. He's too slow but he is reliable for making catches. I'm glad he's overhyped because there's a lot of talent available where he's going in Best Ball drafts.

"Next up we have Jake Ferguson. Vegas predicts the Cowboys to be the 5th best offense this season, Ferguson looks to be the #2 option behind CD Lamb and at 25 years old he fits the mantra of "out with the old and in with the new" to the T. The Cowboys RB room is in shambles and Vegas is still predicting them to be Top 5, to me that screams confidence in Lamb & Ferguson. Those targets and TD's have to go somewhere and they're not all going to CD."

Ferguson is baby Kelce so him. No I'm not putting alot of pressure on him ðŸ˜‚

Dak has historically leaned on his TE and now that thereMs no #2 in Dallas, I expect him to be a draft steal.
