Packers rookie RB MarShawn Lloyd suffered a hamstring injury during today’s preseason game vs. the Browns. 

MarShawn Lloyd - Injured to start camp but returning now. LaFleur likes having multiple backs mix in and I could see Lloyd being the lightning to Jacobs’ thunder. Will be interesting to see if he gets snaps with the 1s in camp.
