Upsides:
    Potential Backup Role: Prince has been competing for the backup role behind Isiah Pacheco, which could lead to significant playing time if Pacheco is injured.
    Preseason Standout: His strong preseason performance has caught the attention of the Chiefs' coaching staff, which may increase his chances of carving out a role.

Downsides:
    Crowded Backfield: With Clyde Edwards-Helaire still in the mix and other options available, Prince may struggle for consistent touches.
    Limited Fantasy Appeal: Unless injuries strike the depth chart, his fantasy value might be limited to deeper leagues or handcuff purposes.

Could be a good dart throw in the final rounds
