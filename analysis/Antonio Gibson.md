"It's interesting to me how well Gibson did historically during my research, and the more I thought about it, the more I realized he could undoubtedly have an impact this year.  He dealt with poor offenses in Washington and was productive despite them.  Rhamondre Stevenson should be the primary back, but as the passing down back, Gibson could be one of the more proven targets on the receiving end.  Their receiver room isn't well known, and they may have trouble being productive in the Patriot's offense this year, but Gibson could provide a check-down target for his QB that makes him fantasy-relevant once again.
