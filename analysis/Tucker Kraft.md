Kraft and Musgrave bring different elements to the offense. Kraft is a dirty work kind of guy, where Musgrave is more of the young Jimmy Graham or Sam LaPorta mold of really big receiver. And I think that gives Musgrave significantly more potential in fantasy. But I also agree that neither is likely to be a fantasy asset in 2024. It’s not just GB having both of them, but also 5 WRs who are legit playmakers. Too many mouths to feed. And if there is a breakout fantasy star among the pass catchers, my money is on Watson or Wicks.

Musgrave has the easier path to fantasy relevance. Kraft is very much a “dirty work” type of TE, while Musgrave is pretty strictly a receiving threat.

Musgraves an do what Kraft was doing. Kraft can’t do what Musgraves can do.  Kraft played well, but comparing how he looked running 5 yard dump offs to how Musgrave looked running go routes, doesn’t exactly make sense. They didn’t play the same role at all.  Musgraves is far and away the superior receiver and he was ahead of Kraft on the depth chart for a reason and will be again.
