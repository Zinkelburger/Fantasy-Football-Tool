"Christian McCaffrey is 28 years old, which is when backs tend to fall apart, and he just came off a 16-game season.  If I were playing the odds, given McCaffrey's injury history and age, he would not play an entire season again."

Christian McCaffrey (If he's healthy, he's incredible) 

Every time I draft him, he gets injured. Then when I pass up on him, he goes off. I can't deal with this.
