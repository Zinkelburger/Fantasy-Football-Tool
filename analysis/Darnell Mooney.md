I know it sounds a bit crazy but Mooney is a speedy smaller player (5'11, 4.38 speed) with good route running and Kirk has always had a history of favoring those guys.

Its a good post despite what some of the others are saying. However, I'm kind of more torn towards Matt Harmon's view on London. I think Mooney can be good in this offense as well but I don't think London will fail. I think we see a lot interesting usage with London but Bjan will definitely be in the mix here as well. 

The issue with Mooney is that he adjusts poorly to the ball in the air and has shaky hands. However, his ability to get open is elite. The worry for London truthers is if Mooney will see a significant amount of targets, regardless of whether he catches them or not. Given that Kirk doesn't like throwing 50/50 balls, I would be genuinely worried

7. This years Nico Collins is Darnell Mooney
My favorite one. The WR who’s perilously close to being deeemed a scrub, but gets a new QB and has a career year. I could have gone with Mooney’s teammate London, but London had higher draft capital so breaking out wouldn’t be a surprise like Collins. I like Mooney to surprise folk
