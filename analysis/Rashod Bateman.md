It’s crazy - he’s not even a year older than Zay Flowers.

Oh God just give up on this guy already r/fantasyfootball

I had him last year and he didn’t have the targets. I don’t see it. Seemed like Lamar liked Agholor more

I mean, I personally ain't drafting Bate, but in his defense, he was banged up or out entirely all, but like 5 gamed last season. Paired with the fact that he was the #3/4 guy on the offense splitting with Agholor and him not having a good season isn't surprising. Now though, he is expected to step up to the wr2 role, how that pans out remains to be seen but i do expect a bit more productivity from him being fully healthy this year and stepping up to a more important role. We all know Andrews will be the top target in Baltimore, though.
