From 2023:
Despite playing just 64 percent of snaps last night, Wan'Dale had the most targets and yards of any Giants WR. He looks to be the one promising WR on this dismal team. Thoughts on him going forward?

He’s the giants best WR 😏
He’s the giants best WR 😒

2024 he is now the WR2 behind rookie Malik Nabers

He's like 5'7 and 150 pounds, do with that what you want. Tough to trust a guy who has already missed a lot of time in his career due to injuries.
