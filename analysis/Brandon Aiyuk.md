Guy likes Brandon Aiyuk, safer pick than Chris Olave

Aiyuk. After all this offseason bs I don’t think he’s going to have a top 15 year. I can live with passing and being proved wrong more than I could live with drafting him and my gut being right.

[offseason had him not practicing, trying to get traded for more money or something]

I agree. If he gets traded he is likely behind schedule. There is no way his head is in it — it would be to mo hard to be focused while going through a difficult / souring negotiation. Was hoping to get Deebo at the 3/4 turn but might be hard now, getting pushed up in ADP

The talk surrounding Aiyuk has always been fucking wild tho. I swear every year the news out of camp is either that he’s having major issues connecting with the team or he’s the second coming of Jesus Christ if he played wide receiver in camp. I wouldn’t worry much about him unless they just outright don’t get his contract situation figured out and he actually sits out. I don’t care all that much for his current ADP but there are certainly other question marks with the guys under him in ADP.

Advance efficiency metrics all say Aiyuk is one of the very best receivers in the league. Lack of volume in SF drops his value because he will have a lot of weeks with 4-5 targets but he's show he can do a lot with those. I'm happy to draft him at ADP whether he gets traded or not

Aiyuk had a true superstar breakout year last year, as a Niners fan I can guarantee he gets more volume than last year - I think Shanahan trusts Purdy more ( understandable PTSD from him having Jimmy G & all the other Niners’ QBs) - and the offense will be more vertical. This will strain the defense even more & be truly balanced

Aiyuk makes me nervous if the contract negotiations fall through and he either holds out or is traded, or worse, put in the doghouse again.
