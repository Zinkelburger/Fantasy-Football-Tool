Ravens HC John Harbaugh on Justice Hill: “He is a high-caliber running back… I think he’s gonna play a lot.” Harbaugh has an 85% reliability rating on usage/workload Coachspeak.

Why use Derrick Henry and Keaton Mitchell when you have justice hill? 😂

Bc Derrick Henry is 30 and Keaton Mitchell will start the year on the PUP list and miss the first 6 games?

Honestly seems pretty reasonable to rotate Hill in on third downs as a pass catching back. Henry has never been a huge threat to catch passes out of the backfield and Lamar and Hill connected on some solid pass plays last year

I agree with your take. Having Henry fresh towards the end of the season in cold weather/playoffs will be a huge help as well. As much as I want to see him run 20+ a game, it's not in the Ravens best interests to try to burn him out early on.

This just sounds like a whole lot of nothing. Henry is gonna get like 75% of the RB carries and all the goal line work. Hill will spell him and probably play on 3rd and long situations etc.

Yea and Hill is just a special teamer really. If Keaton Mitchell didn’t get hurt we’d see almost 0 of Hill.

I don't think Keaton Mitchell is comign back this season, he tore his ACL
