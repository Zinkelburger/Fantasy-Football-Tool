As a Bills fan, I think you're right. Brady knows how to maximize his talent. He'll be used all over the field and will get carries as well. My main issue with him is that I think he'll get a lot of yards but might not be a big red zone target. 

As a former Panthers DJ Moore owner, I used to hate Curtis Samuel for the amount of times he vultured TDs in the red zone

I’m just glad because from what I’ve seen of people in their real league drafts, it seems like Samuel is going a lot later than he has been in all of my mocks. I keep seeing him go like 10th round in mocks but I keep seeing people snag him in rounds 12-14. Hopefully people keep doing that because I really like taking him in that 11-12 range if he’s there.
