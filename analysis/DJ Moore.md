Upside to be top 12 WR like he was last season. Think he will be #1 receiver on bears

"DJ Moore. The dudes a stud and given the recent contract extension he’s the clear #1 of the Bears offense."

"I love DJ but there are a lot of mouths to feed in Chicago. Realistically we have no idea how Williams is going to look, rookie QBs can rarely be trusted.

Given the question [Who’s a player most of the industry is down on that you’re much higher on?] that’s a perfect answer."

"If DJ Moore has a big year, Caleb Williams is a must draft, just due to the fact the other WRs on the team are also very good and will get their share."

"Agreed they didn't give him a huge contract to play second fiddle to Allen or Odunze."

"DJ Moore - Unlike Waddle, he is the WR1 in Chicago, but hasn't shown the consistency of other true WR1s even after his WR1 finish last year (bloated by huge games)."

"Everyone has competition for touches. Keenan Allen will be a possession receiver that will also get some red zone looks and Odunze is just a complimentary piece. 

They paid DJ to be the alpha receiver and he is going to have a very good year in my opinion."

His targets will be down due to spreading the ball more. Eberflus is still a garbage tier head coach who will forget what a pass is if they ever get a lead. And 17% of his yards and 37% of his touch downs came in one game.
I wouldn't avoid dj at his adp. But I'm not reaching earlier either.  

Looks slow in some of the preseason footage. Doesn't mean he can't get a lot of YAC and whatever.
