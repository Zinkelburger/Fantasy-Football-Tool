Ben Sinnott (TE 24, ADP 198): Sinnott was the second tight end off the board in this years draft at pick 53 to the Washington Commanders. He comes into a team led by rookie Jayden Daniels and with a clear alpha WR in Terry McLaurin. From there, things get dicey. Many people here are probably still Jahan Dotson believers but I do think there is enough uncertainty to take a shot on Sinnott. Kliff Kingsbury is the new OC in Washington and in Arizona in 2022, Zach Ertz (who is also on the team) was the TE3 overall through the first 10 weeks averaging 7.6 targets a game until a knee injury ended his season. If Sinnott is able to beat Ertz out and take over that role, there is real fantasy potential here. Of course these are a lot of ifs for Sinnott. In taking him you are rolling the dice on Daniels, Sinnott's ability to beat out Ertz, and Sinnott's ability to beat out Dotson at the number 2 target on this team. So while this is unlikely, Sinnott is worth a flier with another safer tight end to see if he breaks out down the stretch.
