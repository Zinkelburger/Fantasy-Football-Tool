"Romeo Doubs.

What you want in a player is someone who is amazing right away, yeah? Makes sense. Not everyone is going to do that.

What you definitely don't want in a player who never makes progress, and Romeo Doubs is the opposite of that.

He has a real chance to become the go-to for Love while manufacturing touches for Reed, Watson being the downfield threat, and Wicks being a rotational piece. It's his 3rd year, and the sky is the limit for all of them, but I think Doubs could be someone everyone realizes they slept on because he wasn't splashy his rookie season with Rodgers or his second season in a brand new offense with Love."


“Multiple people at Packers camp told me Doubs is the guy who has had the most consistently good showing so far and has separated himself as Love’s go-to guy in any situation” -@DanGrazianoESPN 

Doubs is who everyone is least excited about which means he will lead the Packers in receptions.
