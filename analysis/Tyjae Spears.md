"It's not that Tony Pollard is bad because he isn't, but his role and volume in Dallas inflates him.  If Tyjae and Pollard are splitting the backfield, I think it would only take some time for Tyjae to take over as the slight leader after seeing how effective he looked in his rookie season.  After Derrick Henry left for the Ravens, plenty of vacated carries are available in Tennessee, so even if Pollard takes over a share of them, Spears should have a lot for himself. Plus, he would likely be more involved in passing downs as well."

"Tennessee Titans running back Tyjae Spears might be my favorite running back to select in the later round of drafts this year. A second-year breakout is certainly possible, especially after a strong rookie campaign. Spears rushed for 453 yards and two touchdowns while also catching 52 passes for 385 yards and one touchdown in 2023.

Many people are avoiding Spears in drafts this year because of the offseason signing of Tony Pollard. But we could see the 22-year-old more involved than fantasy managers think in 2024. He should continue to be a weapon in the receiving game and could top over 1,100 yards from scrimmage in Year 2."

"I suspect Jaylen Warren and Tyjae Spears will get non-workhorse levels of play but still be pretty valuable as early plays especially Warren. If you just want a starter who has what seems like likely unquestioned starting volume early, Devin Singletary isn't especially good but unless Tyrone Tracy takes over in training camp he has no competition for looks and Vikings -> Commanders could work out for a modest starter early."

Pollard was the most recent signing so he’ll get his chance. But they seem to really like Spears so he should have a role. What role though? Neither profiles as a clear goal line bruiser. Who gets the goal line? Who gets the passing downs? How many times do the Titans even get to the goal line?

Your bench is going to feel awfully crowded if you have two unpredictable RB3s on the same team and don’t want to drop them.

Spears at least has potential, but he’s in a split backfield and is a more of a lottery ticket if pollard gets hurt than a natural breakout candidate.
