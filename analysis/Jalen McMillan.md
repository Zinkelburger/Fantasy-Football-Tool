[Levitan] Lot of fluff in here on Jalen McMillions. But it’s a foregone conclusion among reporters he’s won #Bucs WR3 job. “In the Bucs’ three receiver sets, McMillan will line up opposite Mike Evans with Chris Godwin in the slot.

You have to play in a deep league to want to draft the WR3 for Tampa as anything other than a flier for injury. And I like the player. Coen will play more three sets, etc but there was a reason Canales was keeping it simple for Baker.

For dynasty though he’s a huge value imo. Evan’s and Godwin are both getting older, he has a realistic shot at being the top option or at worst the WR2 for Tampa in a year or two.
