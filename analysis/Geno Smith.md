[Bell] Geno Smith out indefinitely from Seahawks training camp. Believe to be a knee and hip injury. Mike Macdonald says his Pro Bowl QB is getting imaging tests tonight and seeing a doctor. Sam Howell moves to QB1. For now

Geno was good last year. The line was injured and the offense took a step back so the stats dropped, but his advanced stats were on par with his breakout year

Lot of folks crapping on Geno after last year. I'm a Hawks fan, I've watched a lot of Geno, and I will admit, at first I thought of him as a bridge QB, but now I'm scared of the idea of the Hawks moving on to someone else.
I think we'll look back in a few years and think of Geno like a Kirk Cousins. Kirk was also heavily criticized when he signed with the Vikings, but turned out just fine.
If he's healthy this year, Geno has a floor of QB15 in my opinion. Dude plays good football, and has a good set of weapons at his disposal. If the OL improves, and I think it will, we could see another top 10 year for Geno.
