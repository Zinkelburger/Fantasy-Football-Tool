"At least for ADP value, looking at sleeper, Kyler feels like one of the best picks this year. He's coming off the board as like QB9, but is fully healthy and the offense should be a lot of fun. Plus the defense isn't that great, so I think we can see a lot of shot outs and points scored for the Cardinals this year. "

"I don't think he's going to remain a steal when all the Kyler Murray hype articles start coming out. He's QB #8 / #73 overall right now in full PPR and there's no reason he should go behind Stroud or Burrow and I personally would take him over Richardson."

"Heâ€™s a guy who has legit QB1 upside for a fraction of the price as the top tier. "

I usually like to pick an early elite QB but I felt like Kyler was criminally discounted this season so my strat was to try to get him in the 6th or later, bonus that I could usually get the stack pretty easily. Last two seasons Kyler was healthy with a great WR he finished 3rd and 6th!

Kyler Murray dropping [in ADP] is music to my ears. He's the perfect mid round QB that has a big ceiling and good rushing floor.
