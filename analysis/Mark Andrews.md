No way they can keep Likely off the field with how he played last year

Andrews is an elite receiver and a great blocker, his production shouldn't expect to go down mostly because he shouldn't lose much, if any playing time. There is a theoretical concern of him blocking more and receiving less, but that's not usually how these playbooks tend to work. I wouldn't upgrade or downgrade Andrews at all based on this news.

This news is a slight upgrade for Likely (who has moderate value, as a terrific handcuff to Andrews if you draft Andrews early, or as a potential high-upside TE), and a slight downgrade for any of the Balt receivers.

Andrews doesn't block. I'm not saying he can't. But he doesn't. He isn't asked to do that.

Likely is a beast. Needs to get the ball more. Andrews is fantastic with his volume. Probably not great news for Zay, but Likely has earned it

Seriously though I kinda like Mandrews where he's going. Will likely punt the position though.
