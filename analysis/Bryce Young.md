Bryce Young is the ultimate answer to this. If he doesn’t have a rebound, Panthers are going to have to move on. Thus, I have to believe he will play considerably better.

He had no WR's (33 year old Thielen doesn't count, terrible separator and slow on tape) and no OL and a shit coach last year. Got Canales, who revived Baker and Geno's careers, Panthers signed 3 offensive linemen and drafted a freak athlete WR in Xavier Legette and signed Diontae Johnson, a top 5 separator in the league. He won't get better because he has to, but we will see how good he is with an elite offensive mind at HC, a good OL and some good WR's.

The Canales effect? Geno Smith finished 2022 as QB5, Baker Mayfield finished 2023 as QB10.  Bryce Young worth a flyer?
Significantly improving his weapons, oline and brand new management already have some excited about last years first overall pick.
Dave Canales may be a strange guy but the work he did with Geno as his QB coach in 2022 and Baker as his OC in 2023 can’t be ignored. 

I think he’s probably fine but I would rather just grab him off waivers than spend a draft pick on someone I don’t want to take as a top 12 QB and someone I don’t want to use roster space on as a second QB.
