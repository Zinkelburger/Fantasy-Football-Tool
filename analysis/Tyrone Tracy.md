As a rookie, Tracy knows that he will fall behind if he misses too much information. He didn’t want that to happen, so he rushed back.
Tracy’s speedy return led his teammates to dub him “Paul Pierce,” the Boston Celtics forward who left the court in a wheelchair during the NBA finals in 2008 only to return on his feet a few minutes later.

- Shows his dedication, people on the team like him. Not much predictive power, but a good sign I guess

Upsides:
    Versatile Skill Set: Tracy's ability to play both running back and wide receiver makes him a flexible option for the Giants, potentially giving him opportunities in multiple roles, including special teams.
    Preseason Performance: Tracy showed flashes in the preseason, positioning himself as a potential gadget player who could exploit mismatches.
Downsides:
    Specific Competition: Tracy faces competition from established players like Saquon Barkley, who is the clear lead back, and Matt Breida, who has secured the RB2 role. As a receiver, he’s behind the likes of Isaiah Hodgins, Darius Slayton, and rookie Jalin Hyatt, making it difficult for him to find consistent playing time.
    Injury Concerns: Tracy suffered a non-contact injury during practice, which could derail his momentum and further diminish his chances of climbing the depth chart

Tyrone Tracy: I like Singletary and he was good on the Texans. But the Giants are probably gonna be terrible and a 2 down RB is gonna find it hard to be super viable on a shitty team. Tracy is a converted WR and could end up the starter by season's end and put up solid numbers.
