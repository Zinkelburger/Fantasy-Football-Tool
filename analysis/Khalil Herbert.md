The Bears are screaming at you that Swift is the 1, after that Johnson and Herbert can be the 2 and 2b/3. Sure, if some things break right, Herbert could end up finding success but that’s literally the definition of a handcuff. 

Exactly, the Bears made him a massive priority AND overpaid so make sure they got him. They will use him as the 1. Every argument made here is what the Bears are making in favor of Swift. I'd buy Herbert as a backup when Swift gets hurt, but the price has to be rock bottom for that value.

Khalil Herbert. He’s easily the best runner on the team and could have some stand alone value there. But if Swift goes down, Herbert is a potential league winner.

If Herbert was good CHI wouldn’t have had him behind Monty, then drafted RoJo, signed Foreman last yr, then signed Swift this year.  Herbert has had his chance to be RB1 and hasn’t taken it.  

Herbert is like Singletary, the film and efficiency always look good but for some reason they can’t run away with the job ( although I have a feeling Singletary will crush this season)
