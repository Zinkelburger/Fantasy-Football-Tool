Chiefs WR Marquise “Hollywood” Brown is expected to miss four to six weeks with the sternoclavicular injury he suffered, per multiple sources. 

One the one hand, I feel like Hollywood has been super undervalued due to the shitshow of a QB carousel he has had for half of his time in Arizona due his injuries and Kyler's injuries putting them on the field at separate times. And that he's done fairly well at times when he was catching balls from Kyler.

On the other hand, I feel like his ADP was pumped up due to an early offseason assumption that Rice would be suspended this season, which seems unlikely now.

On my third hand, I am hoping that this really tanks his ADP and that I can feel good about drafting him, slotting him in an IR, and then filling in my K or grabbing another RB handcuff.
