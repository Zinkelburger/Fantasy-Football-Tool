Season stats after all the BS coach speak, 237 yds - 2 TD’s

This is the year. Tank Bigsby has improved so much under this new offense. He’s focused. He’s having fun. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s a dark horse for the Heisman.

The tank bixby and charbonnet stuff from FFBALLERS was the moment I realized those guys are just as dumb as my league mates they’re just funnier. 

He was possibly the worst RB in the NFL last season.

Jags fan here: he has looked much improved through 2 preseason games. Hearing good practice reports as well. Who knows how many opportunities he will get in the regular season, and the jags run blocking is still a major concern.

I think at worst he's a handcuff and it's possible he carves out a decent role for himself. Wouldn't expect him to affect ETN much but at least he's not a fantasy joke anymore.
