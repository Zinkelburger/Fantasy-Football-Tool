"The Packers are in a good fantasy situation for their starting running back.  Jacobs has been very productive in the past.  If he can stay healthy, there's an excellent opportunity to be the lead back in a good offense.  I envision the Packers redshirting rookie Marshawn Lloyd and splitting the workload primarily between AJ Dillon and Jacobs, similar to how they used Dillon his rookie season when they weighed on Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams.  Jacobs was due to have a down season with the number of carries he had the previous season, but he could quickly bounce back this season in an improved system, even if Dillon does steal some of the carries."

"Josh Jacobs - Uber-volume seasons are likely a thing of the past under Lafleur but efficiency and touchdowns should make up for it."

I love Josh Jacobs. He’s a work horse back in a much better offense. He dealt with injuries all last season. Green Bay handed him a big deal when they already had Aaron Jones which leads me to believe they have big plans for Jacobs. 

Josh Jacobs has never not had 1100 yards in a season. One great season, yes, where he led the league in rushing yards. And 4 other good ones. Now he’s going to a better offense. I have no idea why anyone is avoiding him.

People who say this are not taking into account context, they are just looking at yards and YPC. Jacobs has been consistently productive despite dealing with abysmal O-Line play.

And what about the 3 seasons you didn't mention?

He also had negative RYOE/attempt in 2020, 2021, and 2023. Last year he was right there with AJ Dillon, Javonte Williams, and Zeke Elliot.

AJ Dillon still looks like shit, Jacobs should be the clear cut RB1

I'm high on him and I think this is one where people are really overthinking it. He's a good IRL player in a great offense, that right there is like 80% of what you need to be a good fantasy RB. By Week 5 people are going to be kicking themselves for reading too much into his efficiency numbers on a broken Raiders offense last year.

The fact that he's not going to get true bellcow usage is already baked into his ADP. A RB who gets ~15 carries a game, targets in the passing game, and goalline touches has more than enough volume to perform as an RB1.

I think the Packers as a whole are going to pop this year and Jacobs is likely to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that fantasy-wise.

I don't see him in a big timeshare. And even if it's a 65-35 split I see him having all the goal line work which more than makes up for it. I see GB scoring a lot of tuddys; even though I'm not a big fan of Josh, I can't see a reason why he wouldn't have a great season and out perform ADP.

Bad year last year, so going for good value. Post hype, but has a lot of upside.
