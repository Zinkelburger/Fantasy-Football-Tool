"Devin Singletary. Always delivers more than (low) expectation."
"hard to have lower expectations than this year's NYG."

"Singletary has been a top-24 RB in PPR historically.  He became familiar with this system after working under Brian Daboll in Buffalo.  With Saquon gone, there are a ton of open carries to go around and outside of Singletary, but the alternatives are a bit of an unknown.  Singletary could be Saquon-lite this year simply due to volume, and the Giants improved their offense a bit around Daniel Jones, so I could see him ending up as a top 24 guy again."

To me, Singletary has great value at the RB position - looking to be a workhorse for the Giants, and goes in like the 8th/9th round... good pick up for your RB3

So do you think Devin Singletary is a better running back currently than Mixon is? Singletary was great for them last year and I think even though Mixon is older (by less than a year), he is still the better player imo

My vote is Devin singletary. Had a solid season after a slow start to his career, got a contract with a team that held Saquon Barkley back for years
