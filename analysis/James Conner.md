After drafting Trey Benson early in this past draft, I expect the Cardinals to transition to Benson as Conner likely fades over the season health-wise.  However, Conner is healthy for the games, and I expect him to finish strong enough that he ends the season as an RB2 for the year.  The Cardinals offense should be explosive with Kyler Murray back and stud rookie Marvin Harrison Jr. at WR.  They have also worked on their offensive line over the past few off-seasons, which gives Conner enough of a boost to cut being a top 30 RB consistently year-to-year. 

"Feels like the industry is super high on him. Maybe not ADP yet but every analyst I've heard loves him"

"James Conner - If he falls here, I love the value if you need a RB, but plan for things to go south during the middle of the season."

"James Conner will probably smash again. Trey Benson is a good pick too, but James Conner is almost a sure thing at the start of the season"

James Conner. I had him his magical 2018 season and haven't touched him since but he impressed me last year and you can get his handcuff pretty cheap who just so happens to have insane upside.

Conner's best work last year was when Kyler was healthy. Trey Benson hasn't really impressed me thus far in preseason. Since joining the Cardinals, Conner has never averaged fewer than 13.6 PPG.
