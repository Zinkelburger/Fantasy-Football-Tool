"Zack Moss is one I’m in on as well. RB25 ADP on fantasy pros. Hes the starter in a good offense with little competition, sometimes it really is that simple. I know people don’t want to draft a guy they have questions about talent wise, but who is taking the job from him? Chase Brown will play a role but after watching him last year, I don’t think he’s a serious threat to take the starting job. Unless the Bengals go get another RB, Moss feels like a solid RB2 pick going later than he should"

"Zach Moss is pretty boring, basically deemed a JAG every year but he can run and receive and is a capable back. I’d love him as some RB2 I can throw in a pinch"

"I'm not high on Moss because, aside from a few games for the Colts last season, he has no history of being overly productive"

"Leads me to beleiving Zach Moss will be the lead back on this team"
