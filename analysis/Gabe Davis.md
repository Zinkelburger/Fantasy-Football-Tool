The Jaguars for me is definitely Brian Thomas as Gabe Davis hasn't been all that productive and Christian Kirk is a FLEX/borderline WR2 every year - I would prefer the possibility of a Thomas asserting himself as the WR1 vs taking a shot with Kirk. 

Gabe Davis is an excellent blocker, it's why he saw 79% snap share with the Bills

The Jags sought to acquire deep threats for Lawrence because he likes to throw deep, but it’s been proven (or at least reasonably established) that Gabe Davis struggles to earn targets. 

Probably biased as a Bills fan, but I’d dart throw on Ray Davis. Cook seems to have a case of the dropsies that isn’t going away, and considering he dropped some would-be clutch/necessary TDs last year, I wouldn’t be surprised if Davis gets a surge in targets and opportunities, particularly in the red zone. And if Josh Allen stops being the goal line back, Davis is first up for that too.
