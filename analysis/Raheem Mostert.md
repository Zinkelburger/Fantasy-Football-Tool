"Yes he’s old, previously injury prone, has a ton of competition in the offense

But when the Miami offense is on fire he’s an insane ceiling play"

"In my opinion in redraft there’s virtually 0 reason That achane should go more than a round before t lol. It’s the most bizzare thing I’ve seen in fantasy in a while.

When they were both on the field besides the Denver game mostert was literally the more productive player in terms of total output."

"Mostert at RB27 (fantasypros) seems like an awesome value. Obviously not expecting a top 5 finish again, but it’s hard to see him doing worse than RB27. He’s not going to just fall out of relevancy imo, Achane isn’t a guy who is going to get more than 12-14 touches a game, and Miami loved Mostert in the red zone last year. Just feels crazy he’s going so low where he’s around guys like Javonte Williams."

"Mostert. 21 TDs last year - I'll take him in the 7th."

Don't get me wrong. De'von Achane is nasty. I picked him up halfway into the year and couldn't believe what he turned into. The efficiency was off the charts. But let's not act like Mostert wasn't ridiculously efficient too. Achane led the league in yards/attempt at a whopping 7.8. But Mostert almost averaged 5 yards per attempt himself. Achane was first in points per snap among RBs at .548. Mostert was second, with .438. Mostert also led the league in rush attempts inside the 5 yard line and had the third most attempts inside the 10 yard line. McDaniel has, just this offseason, said that Mostert will "lead the [RB] room". And yeah, he's seemingly made of glass. But I STILL legitimately find myself reaching for Mostert a full 2 rounds ahead of his ADP in mocks.
