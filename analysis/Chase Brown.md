"The Bengals vacated a ton of carries when letting Mixon go. They did sign Zack Moss, but I'm not high on Moss because, aside from a few games for the Colts last season, he has no history of being overly productive.  Chase Brown is a second-year back who has experience getting a lot of rushing volume from his college days and is solid regarding receiving.  His skill set should make him a hit in the Bengals system if he can beat out Moss, making Brown a fantasy staple for years. "

"Cincinnati Bengals running back Chase Brown started to get more involved as the season went on in 2023. After seeing just eight offensive snaps in the first 12 weeks, Brown played at least 11 snaps in each of the final six games of the year. In those contests, the 24-year-old totaled at least 50 yards from scrimmage four times.

Now, entering Year 2, look for Brown to break out. Joe Mixon was traded to the Houston Texans this offseason, and the Bengals only added Zack Moss in free agency. While Moss is the favorite to be the starter this upcoming season, the young back will surely get his fair share of touches in the running and passing game. That should help him produce solid fantasy numbers in 2024."

"Chase Brown. Brown was near the top of the league in yards after contact per attempt, yards per route run and targets per route run. Year 2 is when a lot of RB breakouts happen."

Chase Brown - Getting opportunities as RB1 for the team alongside Moss, chance to be RB1 on a great offence.
