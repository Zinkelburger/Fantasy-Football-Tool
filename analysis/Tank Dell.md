"Tank Dell - Incredible rookie year and looks like he has a special connection with Stroud, but is coming off an injury and I still have unanswered questions about how his size impacts his role with even more competition for targets."

Tank Dell - Another great offence with a crowded WR room. Stroud has always spoken very highly of Dell. He’s the cheapest of the 3 WRs in Houston but I wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up being the top fantasy scoring WR on the team. As camp goes on it’ll be good to see how the targets are being distributed and who is on the field in 2 WR sets.
