I love snagging Courtland Sutton and Dontayvion Wicks near the end of drafts 

"WR: Courtland Sutton (WR45) is a shot I’m willing to take late in the draft. If I told you Courtland Sutton outperformed Jaylen Waddle in fantasy points last year, would you believe me? You shouldn’t, because in half PPR, Waddle was WR34 and Sutton WR35. But isn’t that a lot closer than you expected? He is the only veteran on an offense with a rookie QB. While this rookie QB will have college chemistry with the rookie WR, I am willing to see if Sutton’s experience can keep him as the top target."

Broncos players have all been going after pick 100…if [the rookie QB] can even be slightly below average guys like Sutton and Javonte will smash their ADP

I am slumbering through draft season on Sutton. If he proves to be a great asset, I'll be very surprised. His ceiling seems so limited.

I’ve owned him like 3 or 4 times over the years and it never works out. I’m out on him for good.

This is just wrong, the only seasons that you could be disappointed with him was 2018 and 2020. And 2018 was his rookie year so it made sense, and 2020 he tore his acl in the 1st game he played. At his current adp hes defintely worth the value, especially as the #1 wr on the broncos
