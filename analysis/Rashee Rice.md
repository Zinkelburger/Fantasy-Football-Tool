"Rice will get drafted far lower than where he should be because of the legal issues and proceed to play a full season (barring injuries). NFL is probably not going to suspend him until actual legal process plays out."

"Rashee Rice. It doesn’t look like there’s going to be a suspension and he’s my bet to lead the Chiefs in targets this year. Going in rounds 7-9."

"Rashee Rice - Will potentially move up a round or two closer to draft season if word comes out about a lesser suspension, but if not then he is also an absolute smash here."

"When mahomes gives one a 20-25% target share like he did with Rice end of last year I tend to listen "

"Vegas took of his line in lieu of a projected suspension, they aren’t sure how to price him"

"Vegas knows, I’m fading rice"

"In this case it’s the fact that they don’t know. If there’s uncertainty around a player, they often don’t have a line."

Rashee will very likely not be suspended. NFL waits till legal processes to play through before suspension. Otherwise, he already would’ve been suspended. His court date is December 9th and will also likely be pushed back or an extensive process.
