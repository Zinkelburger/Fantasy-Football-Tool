For me it’s Alvin Kamara.. i think he will have elite usage and still put up great numbers with no real threat besides injury riddled Kendre Miller.

Used to like Miller better but with injuries and coach shitting on him not so sure anymore 

Kendre Miller - out minimum 4 weeks 

It’s also hilarious looking on eBay and seeing the massive dump of rare Kendre Miller rookie cards for dirt cheap prices

Kendre Miller falling 40 spots from 130-something to 170-something.

He was being talked about like a league winner, could get a lot of volume if Kamara goes down. Probably safer to not draft him and try to get him on the waiver wire later.
