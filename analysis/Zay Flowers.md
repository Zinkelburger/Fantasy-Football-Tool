"I don’t think Flowers is a #2 realistically, but he’s the one who jumped to mind as a guy who isn’t thought of as a top tier wideout but who is wildly talented and operating in a high-octane offense. I don’t think he’ll be drafted at a discount the way Aiyuk might’ve been, but I think he might be the best comparison just because it’s hard to find a comparison to Brandon Aiyuk—the whole thing with him is that he’s extraordinarily good at football, in a way that there aren’t a lot of comparable talents!"
