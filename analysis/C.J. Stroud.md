"Stroud does not run. He's basically Jared Goff 2.0 in fantasy terms"

I think Stroud will score more fantasy points than Love, but if their ADPs remain several rounds apart, I don’t think Stroud will outscore Love by enough to justify the higher ADP.

So if we were drafting today at their present ADP and I was pretty confident someone else wasn’t going to reach for Love, I’d make that gamble and pass on Stroud.  The Texans running game was straight doo-doo last year and Stroud still lit it up...adding Mixon should really help open that offense up for him to push the ball down field even more.
