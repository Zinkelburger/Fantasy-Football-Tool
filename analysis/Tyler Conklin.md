Tyler Conklin was a surprise for me, but he had 87 targets last year. He also had 0 TD's. With Aaron Rodgers back, I wouldn't be surprised if both those numbers rose slightly. If he had the same numbers with a modest 4 TD's last year he would have been TE12, right behind Dalton Kincaid. I'm not saying he's a world beater, but definitely someone you can get for cheap at the end of your drafts. 

I love Conklin as a serviceable TE with Rodgers playing. He had 87 targets last season and I think he gets some solid red zone targets

Conklin is my favorite punt tight end target. People forget that heâ€™s actually a really good player because he plays for the jets

Conklin feels somewhat similar [to Chigoziem Okonkwo] but in a much better offense. He has to beat Mike Williams to be the number two target but the Jets will most likely be good enough that he can catch a good amount of touchdowns. He also does block at a pretty high rate which is usually pretty bad for fantasy tight ends.
