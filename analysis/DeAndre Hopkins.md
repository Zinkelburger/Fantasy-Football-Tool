"32 year old who'll be rushed back for week 1 with a strain. That's a hard pass for me everywhere."
DeAndre Hopkins could miss 4-6 weeks with strained knee. 

Might actually hurt Ridley if Hopkins isn’t on the field honestly. Ridley isn’t that dude, sorry. But flying around with someone like Hopkins out there on the other side of the field taking attention in the X would help him big time.

If it doesn’t linger at least he should miss a week or two.
