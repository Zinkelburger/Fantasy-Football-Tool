jamaal williams is pretty washed.

Kamara was completely sustained by PPR receptions for piddling yardage last year. They were some of the worst plays in football and with a new OC it’s hard to imagine they are going to continue doing it, but then again it’s hard to imagine why they would play Kamara at all but somehow his backups are the even more decrepit Jamaal Williams and James Robinson so here we are!

The coach hates Miller too much to trust him that's why I like Williams more currently
