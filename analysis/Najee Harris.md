"Najee Harris... ultimately I feel like he's just gonna be a mid RB2 with 1000 rushing yards again but he's boring to watch, frustrating to own because of the down weeks, and the discourse around him is just irritating."

"Jaylen Warren will outperform him, but he will do well the last 5 games of the season, per his usual. It takes him half a season to get going"

"I’m in. Offensive line is much better and he’s playing for a contract. Always bet on a player playing for a contract. Also in on Pitts this year. But then again I’ve never drafted or wanted to draft either before."

"Exactly. Pitts and Najee have always just been too expensive. But they are both at or after round 6 this year both offenses expected to produce more this year."

"Najee is someone I'm targeting in 0RB drafts and bestball. He's not going to have a lot of huge weeks but should be a consistent point scorer."

"In fairness… last time he [Arthur Smith- who is now coaching the Steelers] was an OC, we got prime Derek Henry

Some guys just aren’t meant to be head coaches"

"For real, I’m glad everyone in this thread feels this way because I think this Smith offense is going to go off for the Steelers and I’m trying to grab Warren or Harris late in any fantasy draft I’m in"

"Bunch of squares in this thread. Najee will return great value this year."

"The hate is overblown, but the upside is just not there and he has been trending in the wrong direction year by year with less carries and less receptions each year.

However, he has consistently broken 1000 yards and 7 rush tds each year & last year was the best Y/A of his career. He is solid back end RB2 and has consistently been that ever since his rookie year."

"Najee Harris, something tells me he will be big this year."

"He’s a weird player. He has a high floor but a low ceiling.

It's kinda felt like a low floor and low ceiling the last few years.

Also, Arthur Smith literally doesn't know how football works... I'm tempted to think he'd have learned his lesson last year, but wouldn't be at all surprised if Najee gets the Bijan Robinson treatment."

"Harris has had over 1000 yards every season. He’s hated on, but only like 2 or 3 guys have done that. He’s hated just needs to find the end zone more, and that could definitely happen this year.

Edit: I looked it up, he’s the ONLY rb with over a 1000 yards every season for the last 3 seasons."
