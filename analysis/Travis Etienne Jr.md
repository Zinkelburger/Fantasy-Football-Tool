Upside:

    High Usage and Talent: Etienne finished as the RB7 in fantasy points per game in 2023, with 1,484 total yards and 12 touchdowns across 325 touches​ (PFF)​​ (FantasyPros)​. His ability to handle a heavy workload, combined with his explosive playmaking skills, makes him a valuable asset.
    Goal-Line Opportunities: He ranked high in red-zone touches and goal-line carries, which significantly boosts his touchdown potential​ (Pro Football Network)​.
    Consistency: Despite a dip in performance after the bye week, Etienne maintained a high snap rate and route participation overall, ranking 6th and 7th respectively in these metrics​ (FantasyPros)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:

    Offensive Line Concerns: The Jaguars' offensive line struggled last season, with one of the lowest run-blocking grades in the league. Limited improvement in this area could impact Etienne's rushing efficiency and overall performance​ (PFF)​.
    Reduced Workload: Head Coach Doug Pederson indicated plans to manage Etienne's workload more carefully to keep him fresh throughout the season. This could result in fewer snaps and touches, especially with the presence of backups like Tank Bigsby​ (FantasyPros)​​ (Pro Football Network)​.

"The Jaguars O Line fucking sucks and they didn’t do anything about it this offseason. So not really interested"

"The giant weak spot of their OL was center and they did upgrade with the addition of Mitch Morse. LT Cam Robinson was both suspended and injured for most of last season, so his return will be a big improvement. And Anton Harrison should only keep improving. Think their weakness is biggest at LG with Ezra Cleveland. I’m not saying the Jaguars OL is good, but if they stay healthy, there’s a good chance they are bottom of league like last year."

"Had him last year, buoyed early by tds. Think last year will easily be his best year ever, have no interest in him unless he falls to late round 3"

"Now to etienne. If you believe anything coaches are saying at this point in the off season you probably haven’t played long enough to under stand it’s all smoke this time of year. The jaguars specifically can say whatever they want, the reality is they will need to win every single game possible just to POTENTIALLY make the playoffs. When you need to win every game possible just to maybe get into the post season, your best players are always on the field. If you’re worried about Jacksonville’s line being worse than last year, well etienne might see 100 targets in the air this year. I like etienne a lot as he’s going to see another season with 300+ touches."

"I like him where he’s going late 2nd; coaches spout coach speak all the time about not overworking RBs… thing is, once you get into the season and you’re in the hunt and every other RB on the team is clearly inferior, giving worse players a lot of work and losing gets you fired. If Bigsby can’t do way better than last year, they have to keep feeding Etienne.

It’s in general a good year to buy low on the Jags offense; one of the highest number of vacated targets in the league, TLaw should see positive regression and they invested a lot in fixing the OL. Etienne also has a good receiving floor on top of high expected workload and minimal competition."

Travis Etienne (Surprised to see many analysts low on him; has chemistry with Lawrence with a high PPR ceiling) 

Yeah, ETN is good. A workhorse that is working behind the WW2 trench. He looked good in the open field but my god, dude was met at before the line of scrimmage all the time in 2nd half of last season. I think he's a fantastic late 2nd round pick and just barely behind Breece and Bijan.

I love Etienne but that Oline is a train wreck and another disaster waiting to happen

Most undeservedly slept on RB this year and last. In a game where volume, youth and PPR ability are key he checks every damn box.
