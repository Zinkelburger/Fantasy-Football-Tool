 Like hey so cheap and will have a few games each year but will he really be helpful in my line up every week? Do I have to constantly consider putting him in or out? Yes heâ€™s going to out score his ADP but does he actually help my team??? 

Rostered Lockett a few times over the last few years. He's good for matchups where you're projected to lose and need to roll the dice on boom but a risky start when you're projected to win and need him to not bust.

"Tyler Lockett is a QB-agnostic stud with a stable floor and a week-winning ceiling. Also he's in like +90% of snaps iirc. Like a costco membership he's all around great value"
