"Even at a percentage of what he used to, Aaron Rodgers will be a tremendous improvement over the Quarterback play Breece Hall had to endure last season.  The Jets offense was outright putrid the previous year, and Breece Hall was still the RB2 Overall in PPR last season.  Imagine what he can do in a Jets offense that isn't going to try to make Dalvin Cook a thing, a much better QB that elevates the system of the offensive coordinator, an improved offensive line overall, and a better passing game if Mike Williams can prove out to remain healthy.  Hall could see a significant improvement over an already impressive fantasy season last year if everything hits."

"They go back to back, so the market looks at them in basically the same manner. Much like the rest of the Falcon’s offense, Bijan is being propped up by his prospect grade and Cousins arrival/ falcon’s Coaching change.

For that reason, I also like Breece more. That said while I don’t think he is a bigger threat than Allgeier, I think you and the market are underrating Allen as a touch vulture. The Jet’s declared him the 2nd RB very quickly, and actually used a bit of rotation with Breece his rookie season. If the mindset becomes “we need a big guy on the goaline” then Breece owners might find themselves upset with how many TD’s Allen will get."

"Breece has basically 0 competition for touches. While it's speculate that Braelon Allen could have a role, it's more likely he is nothing other than a handcuff. Breece out touched Bijan in 2023 despite low rushing usage in games where the Jets OL couldn't create a single hole in the defensive line and tons of drives were wasted by the Jets being dead least in 1st downs per game, a full 3.9 1st downs per game behind the Falcons."

"I am of the opinion that Breece Hall should be drafted over Bijan Robinson in every format, but especially in standard/half PPR. Though these are my own opinions I believe there is a lot of evidence and stats to back them up. This is a very long post, and if any Jets or Falcons fans want to chime in with deeper insight into their teams, please feel free!"

Upside:

Explosive Playmaker: Hall is known for his ability to break big plays, both on the ground and through the air. He averaged 3.43 yards after contact per rush in 2023, which showcases his resilience and ability to gain extra yards​ (New York Jets)​.
Versatility: Hall’s proficiency as a pass-catcher out of the backfield adds a valuable dimension to his game, making him a dual-threat in both rushing and receiving categories​ (Heavy.com)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:

Offensive Line Concerns: The Jets’ offensive line has been inconsistent, which could impact Hall's production if not improved​ (New York Jets)​.
Injury History: Coming off an ACL tear in 2022 and dealing with minor injuries in 2023, there is always a risk of re-injury or limited performance due to lingering effects​ (New York Jets)​.
Coaching Adjustments: Hackett’s initial underestimation of Hall’s skills may raise concerns about optimal utilization. However, adjustments throughout the season have shown improvements​ (Heavy.com)​.

Breece Hall (Better QB play should make him build off of last year's breakout)
