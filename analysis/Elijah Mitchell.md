Returning to #49ers practice today: RB Elijah Mitchell

Mitchell was awful last season. They never showed much faith in Mason despite seemingly performing well.

Mitchell was never awful, just always injured. He's #2 unless he loses it himself this year. Mason has always been right behind Mitchell. You can tell Shanny liked him when he started favoring him over Sermon (anyone remember him?). Mason has looked even better this offseason but I still think its Eli's spot to lose. Weird you say hes awful when he had some good runs when he came in for CMC. The bigger problem was Shanahan NOT putting him in for CMC when he should have (for rest in pointless moments) and him just being constantly injured. Injury is awful in and of itself but the talent is there.


I don't think it's a stretch to say he was awful. First of all, the availability is the best ability and he has lacked this ability in a big way his whole career.

But more directly to my point, last year:

Christian McCaffrey: 272 atts, 1459 yds, 5.4 ypa, 90.6 PFF grade

Jordan Mason: 40 atts, 206 yds, 5.2 ypa, 84.7 PFF grade

Elijah Mitchell: 75 atts, 281 yds, 3.7 YPA, 70.1 PFF grade

Tyrion Davis-Price: 6 atts, 21 yds, 3.5 YPA, 60.3 PFF grade

He objectively did not perform well, even when healthy last year. I understand that CMC is the best running back in the league by a wide margin, but we're talking about 29% lower YPA efficiency than Jordan Mason - a massive gap. The niners offensive scheme should easily enable RBs to achieve 4+ YPA and he couldn't even reach that over a substantial sample size.

Not mention he has a complete lack of pass-catching ability. Not to say that Mason or Guerendo have proven to have that, just another knock on Mitchell.

Mitchell was ok last year when he got touches. He might have won people championships in wk 17 for those who had the balls to start him. 

Yea, I don't think very many people watched the games. Mitchell was the #2 guy when he wasn't injured and he had some good plays. Mason is also good and I like what I see in him this preseason. I think he will be very close to Mitchell this year. I'm hoping Shanny mixes him in some more but Mitchell is still great when healthy.
