The Steelers have a bottom 3 WR room IMO even with Wilson. They have Pickens and about 10 WR5s

I drafted an unreasonable amount of this guy in best ball as I thought he was a secret sleeper

WR Roman Wilson. I see why he could have a shot to develop into a starter, but I think he has enough work ahead that he's not worth an early-round draft capital. Just because a player knows some techniques with routes and releases doesn't mean he knows how to perform them at the right time and with the right sense of artistry. His pacing, timing, and selection of techniques need improvement for him to become a reliable starter in a lot of schemes.

News: 3 days agoWilson (ankle) said Wednesday that he won't be available for Saturday's preseason finale against the Lions, Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports.
Spin: That said, Wilson indicated that he hopes to be back in action soon. The rookie third-round pick suffered a left ankle sprain at the end of July, and at that time, he was viewed as week-to-week. Given that he's still sidelined, the rookie's status for the Sept. 8 regular-season opener in Atlanta is unclear. Once he's healthy, Wilson will look to secure a steady role in a Pittsburgh wideout corps headlined by George Pickens.
