" RB: Rachaad White (RB13) finished as RB8 last year. He is very boring and not breaking records for efficiency, but was pretty instrumental for Baker in the passing game. While coaches have talked about reducing his volume (he was tied with McCaffery in total attempts, only behind Henry — tell me whose the odd man out), fourth round draft pick Bucky Irving could come and take a role and still leave lots of volume for White. "

Rachaad White (Even without Canales, he should see high usage)

I think most people’s biggest concern with White is rushing efficiency. Sure, if they just keep peppering him with targets and giving him a huge share of the rushing volume, he could definitely put up similar numbers to last year. But it’s definitely not a given that his usage doesn’t fall off if his efficiency doesn’t improve.
Other than that, he’s a great value pick for the ADP and a lot of people (myself included) are really high on him for the reasons you mentioned and think he can quietly have another RB1 season. If he were on a sexier team or had a sexier skill set, he’d also be going way higher. People just discount him for the same reason Mike Evans continually outperforms his ADP year after year: people just forget about the Bucs. Also even though they were a solid unit last year, people have issue trusting Baker and that offense to replicate or improve upon their play from last year.
