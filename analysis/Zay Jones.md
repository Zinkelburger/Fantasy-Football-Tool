Much needed depth with Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch our only other WRs with decent experience

Best of luck to Zay. Injuries and inconsistency was his issue last year here but had some real good moments with us and still a solid WR.

Zay, you can be our #2, the conditions are very simple - just turn around in the endzone and look for the ball. That's it.

Kyler's got some weapons. Cardinals are going to surprise a lot of people this yearZay Jones' 2023 season was marred by injuries, limiting his impact to just 34 receptions for 321 yards and 2 touchdowns in 9 games. Despite the challenges, his performance in the final four games hinted at his potential when healthy, averaging 8 fantasy points and just south of 10 targets/game. His signing with the Arizona Cardinals after being released presents a fresh opportunity, and if he can maintain his health, he could become a valuable asset in their offense as No. 3 option.
