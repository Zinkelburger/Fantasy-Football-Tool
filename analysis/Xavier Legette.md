Legette is a one-year breakout in college who's profile isn't a lock to translate to the NFL. He's also on the woeful Panthers with Bryce Young as his QB who hasn't shown the ability to support multiple pass catchers for fantasy, and Dionte Johnson is expected to devour targets.

Legette is a spicy late round pick cause of lack of competition.



    6’3” 225 lb rookie receiver
    Traded up from 33 to get back into the 1st Rd (32) to select him which allows for a 5th year option on his contract
    71/1,255/7 receiving in 2023 at S. Carolina
    May see rush attempts (Deebo role)
    Expected improved passing game with new HC Dave Canales who was mostly involved in Geno, Baker comebacks
    Likely the WR2 with WR1 upside if Diontae Johnson misses time
