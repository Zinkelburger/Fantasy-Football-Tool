Sam LaPorta
"yeah I love taking LaPorta in the third"

"I can see people stretching to take Laporta early. Could work out, but you never know with TEs."

"I dont see a reason to reach for laporta or Allen in the 2nd tbh

Laporta is great but there’s a large amount of TEs to rock with that won’t require a 2nd round pick, and picking your qb early is almost always a mistake"

"Sure hes likely to regress, or hes also ready to be the next Travis Kelce"

Laporta is being drafted at his absolute ceiling. If Laporta hits his assumed floor of 14, you lost value, if he hits his assumed ceiling of 16.9 you basically matched his value. He is a pick of faith at the moment, you're taking him over other skill position players that have a much more realistic shot at hitting the 16.9 number or even exceeding it. Not to mention, 4 of the other 5 guys who have a realistic shot at matching or exceeding his production or all being taken 1.5-3 rounds later and around other players who are more likely to match their production as oppose to exceed it. Obviously, Kelce is different because he has shown WR1 production in the past, Laporta hasn't even hit the average elite TE ceiling of 16.9 yet he is being drafted as if that's his floor.
TE positional advantage is great, but it is supposed to be great because you greatly exceed the other TEs while also returning at least floor value in the other positions, seems you may be risking massive value lost if you draft a 14ppg TE at an ADP where the other skill positions can put up numbers as high as 20fppg. You lose even more value if the other later round guys exceed Laportas finish. 

I don’t think any of the top 5 TEs have a significant advantage over the others. LaPorta and Kelce are going about 2 rounds ahead of Andrews so I’m almost never grabbing either of those top 2.

TDs can be wildly unpredictable. If he basically has the same year with 5 tds instead of 10 people are going to be disappointed.

Not saying he can’t do it, but you need LaPorta to repeat a 85/900/10 kind of statline to return on his draft price, and not even Kelce has ever scored double-digit TDs in back-to-back seasons. The days of elite tier TEs being a locked in 5 point a week average over everyone else are over.
Really fun IRL player, but round 3 in PPR? Hard pass.
