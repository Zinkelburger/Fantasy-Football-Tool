"Mike Evans. Every year we all think to ourselves “this is the year mike evans falls off”. Then we get to week 15 and evans has 1000 rec yards and 7-10 tds. At this point in the season we all think to ourselves “damn I should’ve trusted him he produces like this every year, I shouldn’t have gotten cute and drafted christian watson’s bum ass”.

Then the cycle repeats."

"Evans is the most slept on/underrated superstar in general. He’s heading towards the hall of fame and a lot of people would have no clue lol."

"Redditors have recency bias. He was cheap last year (because it was frustrating as fuck owning him in 2022).

He was correctly/slightly overpriced in the previous years."

"WR: Mike Evans (WR17) proves that we never learn. He finished WR4 last year! I don’t give a shit if Godwin gets more work in the slot under blah blah blah’s new system, who fucking cares? Evans and Godwin are that entire passing offense, until Cade Otton comes in and gets a 6-yard touchdown. When was the last time the Buccaneers had a third receiver you could name? Scotty “The Flash” Miller, probably, and not because he was anything special. The WR4 on the year should not be available where he’s going."

"He’s 30. He could fall off a cliff with no warning. That’s his floor"

"Essentially this. The ADP bakes in the risk of his eventual downfall. The year is impossible to predict so as players age the ADP generally reflects the risk of the player falling off a cliff at some point. 

To everyone wondering, look up WR numbers after they turn 30 and you'll see historically they very rarely return top 8 WR numbers."

"But yeah, people thinking WR15 is his ceiling are just not looking at what happened last year. He is the primary receiver in red zone situations and that isn't changing. I'll take a guaranteed fade route to Evans multiple times a game thank you."
