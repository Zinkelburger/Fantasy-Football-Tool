"Jaylen Waddle is being drafted at his floor. Ton of injuries last season, left games early and missed some, horrible TD luck. But to throw some cold water on this Waddle doesn't get very many RZ targets at all. A lot of his TD's were off the back of massive YAC. Don't think McDaniel trusts him as a RZ threat, ball always seems to go to a back or Tyreek."

"Jaylen Waddle - Waddle is just a really freaking good player in his prime and I am trusting the talent to win out as WR2 on a great offense pending health."

"I just never feel good coming out of a draft when my WR1 isnâ€™t the top target on his own team"

Bad year last year, so going for good value. Post hype, but has a lot of upside.
