WR Mike Williams has been activated off of the PUP list, a big step as he recovers from a torn ACL. 

Him and Christian Watson are off all my draft boards. Made of paper thin glass

Donâ€™t you ever disrespect my boy Mike like that again. He sacrificed his ACL so that I could win that week.

Mike Will is being drafted at his floor. No one is hyping him. Makes me mega bullish.

Youâ€™d need a guy thatâ€™s never healthy to stay healthy in one of the worst stadiums for turf and his QB to stay healthy and still be good, which we havenâ€™t seen in 2 years.

Sounds like the start of a 90s family sports drama movie. Bullish.

This comment is a reminder that mike williams scored 16.7 ppr points per game last season ðŸ˜Ž

â€¦well, 3 games! But thats like 1/6th of a season! Not the worst sample size!

I have unintentionally drafted Mike Williams for like 4 years straight. Not planned just kept happening based on the draft and whoâ€™s available. This year I told myself I wonâ€™t no matter how much hype.

I've been seeing Mike Williams go undrafted lately. I'd love him as my WR3.

Really glad he came off of the PUP List as early as he did
He could be extremely undervalued.

I don't have much interest at all in this offense outside of Hall and Wilson. Williams is a god awful pick at his ADP of 100 in my opinion
