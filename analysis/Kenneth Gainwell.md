Sure, Saquon may command a larger share given his receiving talent, but Philly's coaching clearly trusts Gainwell and he could still siphon enough targets away to be noticeable since the RB target pie is still tiny.

Just a guy unfortunately. Team really likes him but he’s not a big enough piece in their offense to expect anything of fantasy relevance

Idk he's RB2 on the Eagles. Going at ADP 230. Seems strange.

Swift wasn’t trusted in pass protection, so that job mostly went to gainwell. So I think the team will hang onto him for a while. It’s possible he emerges as the best option one of these years (like how Josh Adams was the leading rusher in 2019), but I don’t think gainwell will ever be a top 20 back

I don’t really want any RB on the eagles or ravens. Everyone loved swift going there and on PPR he finished RB20 for total points. On a PPG basis he was RB24 at 12.5 PPG. They use a committee approach and have hurts stealing yards and TDs. Hypothetically even if gainwell becomes “the guy” he would just be the leader of a 3 RB rotation. They would use Scott and probably bring in one bigger back for goal line work. His ceiling is most likely a flex play/bye week filler.

Swift averaged 16.93 points per game through week 11(not counting week 1 which he didn't play) before that team went off the rails and thats with all his tds being vultured. That first half pace is probably rb4/5. There was a lot of shit going wrong on that team. I'm willing to blame the coaching for that disaster. If a good rb landed in Philly I would not be scared to buy, just have the expectation of vultured touchdowns
