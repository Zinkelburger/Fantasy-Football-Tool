49ers Rookie WR Ricky Pearsall (shoulder) will not return to practice this week, per Kyle Shanahan. Pearsall will not get any preseason action. 

Ricky Pearsall in deep league

I watched the CJ Stroud and Micah Parsons draft stream and CJ was devastated when the 49ers picked [Pearsall] up. That alone will have me drafting him at the end of my draft. I doubt anyone else in my league is even sniffing him.
