Johnston is on the verge of being cut lol.

Bro I took a swing on him in my keeper league based more on situation than anything else. I’ve followed him closely and his underlying metrics, eye test, and really everything except his draft capital are terrible. Won’t be keeping him, I’ve seen plenty of bust WRs being an eagles fan. He’s it.
