"Jonathan Brooks or another rookie who might break out second half"

"In the past, new Carolina Panthers Head Coach Dave Canales has been involved with influencing resurging the careers of Geno Smith (in Seattle) and Baker Mayfield (in Tampa Bay), so we should see at least improvement in the second year for Bryce Young.  Now, Jonathon Brooks still has a while to go concerning injury recovery.  If he fully recovers by the start of the season, then being in the Rachaad White role of this offense after the Panthers made him the first RB off the board in the NFL draft should bode well for Brooks' fantasy production.  Typically, when teams draft a guy early in a million-dollar industry and get paid to make real-life decisions in Carolina, they believe in Brooks."

"Breakout rookie: Jonathon Brooks. The Panthers invested heavily in rebuilding their offensive line. They drafted Brooks in the second round as the first RB drafted. And the competition at RB is Chuba Hubbard and Miles Sanders, which is mid at best. I’m buying as much Brooks as I can as long as his ADP stays nice and low. Even if he starts the season splitting snaps, he won’t be splitting for long. He’ll rise well above his station on current draft boards. Currently, at least on sleeper, the 27th RB being drafted by ADP. "

I'm big on Chuba this year, because of where you can get him. Last year when he got the oppertunity to take most the carries, he had some solid games.
I'm also in the camp of thinking that Brooks will smash next year, but I don't see the coaches needing to rush him out and give him a big work load. Chuba is on a contract year as well. If the team isn't going to make the playoffs, why would you rush out a rookie who missed camp and OTA's, that is coming off an injury, for a team that won't make the playoffs. I personally see more of a split, like a 1A/1B type role for Brooks.
I know the fantasy community is big on Brooks, but I just don't see the actual football logic behind it. On top of that, I think Brooks ADP is too high because of the community thinking that. I mean on Sleep ADP, he is going around Javonte Williams, Zach Moss, Devin Singletary, Brian Robinson Jr, and Tyjae Spears. I would take any of those guys over Brooks, but that's just my opinion. 

I do think Brooks will be great next year, but really does feel like a really expensive bet.

I don't understand people who expect brooks to be relevant. Just look at the situation for what it is:
Brooks tore his ACL, he needs to rehab that injury first, history has shown RBs who come back from a torn ACL perform bad in their first year, so far he hasn't practiced at all with the team, meaning he will start getting some reps mid season for the first time since his injury.
And out of no where, people expect him to beat out Hubbard or Sanders right away just because he got taken in the 2nd round?
If I had to make a prediction, if everything goes great for brooks, he gets some carries in December. And that's that, when the panthers won't qualify and call it a season for him, likely even let him finish on IR.
Brooks at 60 on ESPN is the worst ADP on a player I've seen in years

Jonathon Brooks - No news yet, still recovering from ACL tear, but I’ll be keeping an eye out for when he gets back to practice. Has great talent and is playing for a HC that likes to run the ball and utilize his RBs in the pass game.
I highly doubt he plays in preseason and the indicator is going to be whether he avoids pup to start the season which is at least 4 missed weeks.
Fwiw, he has not practiced at all yet. I would assume he needs to be practicing soon if he were to play week 1.
If I get him and I'm thin at rb, I try to get chubba late as well and I'll cut him once Brooks is ready and stash Brooks on ir if that's an option. One nice thing is if Brooks doesn't play in preseason, his ADP could drop a bit. I'm hoping to get him cheap and have him as a keeper for next year at low cost.
