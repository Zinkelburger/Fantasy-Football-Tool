"What changes did I miss? Are people scared that GP1 can’t slot into the WR1 role after Diontae Johnson’s departure or is the Cousins factor getting crazily overhyped?

I like London as a player but he‘s an absolute fraud pick in the 2nd round imo."

"The only reason I am nervous about not drafting London is that everybody here thinks he is overdrafted and not worth his ADP. This is not an unpopular opinion."

"London as a rookie had 32% targets per route run. That is too 5 in the league type stuff. The reason he hasn’t really produced is Arthur Smith and horrendous QB play"

"Of course his ADP may not pay off, but the bet here is on a more modern offense that's not terrified of throwing more than 25 times a game."

"I do think there are reasons to be excited about London, given the new QB and OC. But not second-round excited.

It's also interesting that his ADP is a good bit lower on Sleeper than on ESPN or Yahoo!"

"It cannot be overstated how large the upgrade from Desmond Ridder at QB and Arthur Smith calling plays to Kirk Cousins at QB and Morris/Robinson calling plays is. I think being out on London in the 2nd is generally reasonable, since there's a lot of projection in his draft price, but we've seen Cousins heavily target his favorite players and sustain multiple different offensive weapons in fantasy. Everything we saw with London has been with some of the worst QB play we've seen this millennia; upgrading from awful to good could easily see him as a top-10 WR."

" I mean, is London's ceiling a low end WR1? Maybe. Yet, I'm supposed to take him as WR12 overall? He basically needs to hit his ceiling to break even on his cost at ADP12. He's overvalued. "

London may be ranked in top 20 fantasy WRs but he is not a top 20 WR.

Drake London falls firmly into the category of "I can live with not drafting this guy whether he ends up producing or not"
I just don't quite get as excited about him as other WRs that are being drafted around him. FantasyPros has him at WR12 with guys like Olave, Pittman, Aiyuk, Evans, Waddle and Moore around him and honestly I'd prefer most if not all of those guys over him.
