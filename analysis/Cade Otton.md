Looking at projected points for the TEs, the top 6 (Kelce, Laporta, Mcbride, Kincaid, Kittle, Andrews) are all descending within a few points of each other from highest 205 to lowest 186, than a 10 point drop to Pitts, another 10 point drop after him, another 10 guys descending from 166-136, then a cliff dive to 108. The dive happens with Cade Otton, ADP around 200. (so the bottom of the TE cliff). Probably can find a better TE.

If the draft goes to like ADP 220+, then I'm just waiting until any TE slides past their ADP, or grabbing Kmet/Conklin/Henry/Otton in that order.
