"This was a theme all season though. Derek Carr is just not a good QB. Consistently misses reads, refuses to go through his progressions just to check down the ball, throws inaccurate passes when he does try to make big throws, and consistently missed Olave on routine routes like crossers, slants and fly routes. It was excruciating to watch Carr routinely kill drives with bad throws or immediately checking it down to Kamara. Having actually watched the games this was a constant issue. While I don't think Pete Carmichael (old Saints OC) was good, a huge part of the blame is on Carr for always fucking missing big plays to throw the checkdown. "
