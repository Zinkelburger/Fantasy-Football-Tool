He's good but the Washington O-line is very bad

"I think an underrated option is Brian Robinson. Coaches seem to like him and he was seeing a bit more usage as the year went on. He also started seeing surprising receiver work: 25 of his 43 targets came in his last 6 games. He got red zone work and at 6' 1" 225 should continue to do so."

Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury says Brian Robinson is very clearly an RB1 and is thrilled with where he is.

I think we see much more Robinson than Ekeler.

B-Rob is being undervalued. I don’t think this will be even close to a 50/50 split between the two. And if it did start that way, I’d assume B-Rob takes more of the lions share as the season progresses, given ekelers age and whatnot.
