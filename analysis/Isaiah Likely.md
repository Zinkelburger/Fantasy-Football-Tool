I think the only scenario Likely sees the 2nd most targets is if Andrews misses the majority of the season.

If everyone stays healthy, even if the Ravens run 2 TE, I think Likely still falls behind Andrews, Flowers, and probably Bateman in target totals.

On a Per Route Run basis sure. But even if none of the WRs pop off itâ€™s still really hard for a guy who spends at least half of all offensive snaps on the sideline or blocking to beat out the guys running routes on 90% of snaps.

TE2 behind Andrews. Probably don't want to draft. Waiver wire pickup if Andrews gets injured.
