From 2023: 
I’m so bummed about buying the hype in the off-season about Fields taking a “step forward.” He’s clearly regressed and his offensive coordinator is having a terrible season. I may regret my early round pick when I could have gotten guys like Kirk Cousins many rounds later.

Justin Fields Dynasty Value: Buy-Low on the Steelers QB Before He Beats Out Russell Wilson

Dude can’t read a defense in a reasonable amount of time. Bears fans complained about the O-Line but it’s rating is middle of the pack he just took forever to make reads.
He’s not better than Russell. Good luck.

Agree. He holds on to the ball way too long and locks onto his primary target and can't lead defenses away. That was kind of the thing that NFL Coaches were supposed to "coach" out of him, but at some point you just have to accept that it's probably too late to teach something so fundamental to being a good QB. And I was cheering for him after he torched Clemson for like 4 or 5 TD's.

Man people really can't accept that the guy just sucks. He's bad in Chicago after being given tons of chances, and the NFL collectively agrees the guy sucks as they refuse to trade anything of value for him, and yet people still go "buy low."
