"Gibbs was a rookie last season, missed two games, and finished as a Top 10 PPR RB.  Not much has changed besides David Montgomery, who has gotten older by another year.  While I expect the split to still exist with Montgomery, I think Gibbs grows off of his first year in the league and that the Lions will favor Gibbs more this season.  Gibbs' involvement in the passing game also keeps him relevant in PPR.  The Lions' offensive line is one of the best units in the league, and Gibbs should keep pumping into the top 10 as a PPR RB again this year."

"Jahmyr Gibbs - Hyper-talented pass-catching back with great game-script and top 3 offensive line. The lack of certainty around his goal-line usage and between-the-tackles work is concerning, but that's the only thing keeping him out of the Breece + Bijan tier."

Potential Upside:

    Versatile Usage: Gibbs is expected to be utilized heavily in both the running and passing games, capitalizing on his ability to create mismatches against defenders. His versatility was evident in 2023 when he produced 1,261 total yards and 11 touchdowns on 234 touches​ (Pro Football Network)​.
    Increased Role: With a season of experience and Johnson's creative schemes, Gibbs is anticipated to see an expanded role. His efficiency, with 5.2 yards per carry and strong performance in the red zone, makes him a valuable asset​ (Detroit Lions)​.
    Offensive Synergy: The Lions' offense, featuring solid talent around Gibbs including Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown, provides a supportive environment for sustained production​ (Pro Football Network)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:

    Shared Backfield: David Montgomery’s presence could limit Gibbs' touches, especially in goal-line situations. Montgomery was a significant factor in 2023, and his role isn't expected to diminish drastically​ (Pro Football Network)​.
    Consistency Concerns: While Gibbs showed flashes of brilliance, maintaining consistent production week-to-week is crucial, especially in a fantasy context. Monitoring his workload and injury status will be key.
