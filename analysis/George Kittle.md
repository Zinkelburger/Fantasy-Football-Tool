"Kittle. I think some people nervously fade him because he's a volatile scorer, but he still provides those 20+ point games, and finishes top 5 every year. For a guy that has fallen to rounds 5-7 in the last few years"

"George Kittle is a great player, great offense and will get the ball. The floor is bad but TEs with his ceiling do not exist anywhere else in the draft other than Laporta, Kincaid and McBride."

"Don’t understand why kittle isn’t considered elite after going over 1000 yards but ok"

"You're either getting 4 pts or 25"

That's not even what happened though. Kittle scored 3 points or less seven times last season. Two times he scored less than 1 point. He only had one 20+ point game in week 5.

Yeah, he was extremely volatile and it was kinda crazy. More so than ever in his career. The idea is that the volatility regresses a bit back to the normal (while still volatile)

Draft George Kittle and hate myself when he only has 3 points one week, then swear I’m a fantasy genius the next when he drops 18-20
