The only thing that has me uncertain is the amount of change around him. New QB, Keenan Allen and Odunze are sure to offer a lot more than … I honestly can’t remember who their pass catchers were outside of DJ Moore.

Had significant targers last year, but now could have a lot more competition due to the additions of WRs Allen and Odunze

Kmet is a guy I liked last year but the additions of Keenan Allen and Rome pretty much destroy any upside he would have had. In order to be an elite fantasy tight end, you pretty much need to be a top two target on your team and Kmet looks like he is going to be fourth on this team as of right now.

Right but if we're talking about punting to round 10+ he's not a bad option. He's big enough to have a role in the offense. The defenses can't focus on him and he'll be a good safety net for the rookie qb

He does block at a relatively high volume and between those three WRs and Swift there's not much left for him. He does have somewhat of a floor compared to guys around him but I don't really see the ceiling there.

I figure when punting on the your basically looking for floor. Every year in the league can get a couple tuddies and have a big game out of nowhere. If your not grabbing one of elite guys your just looking for someone who won't pull your roster down.

Overall, not exactly a guy I'm targeting but if all the guys I am get taken, I could do worse.
