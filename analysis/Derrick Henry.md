"What do mayonnaise, potato chips, and milk have in common? They have expiration dates. But not the true King (sorry Lebron & Louis). Henry is the Shaquille O’Neal of running backs and this is his Miami Heat year. Although this Baltimore offense probably won’t go quite as run-heavy as Tennesse, the team upgrade, lack of receiving options outside of Andrews, and little competition sets up Henry to EAT touchdowns. He’s one of the most efficient backs in all of football and his volume will be there, especially in the red zone."

"Henry. If that offense opens up, teams have to decide between Zay, Andrews, Henry, and Lamar. That leaves Henry in space with a single LB or safety on him, and may God help that person."

Derrick Henry (Even at his age, should be a TD machine in that system)

This just sounds like a whole lot of nothing. Henry is gonna get like 75% of the RB carries and all the goal line work. Hill will spell him and probably play on 3rd and long situations etc.

People are expecting Henry level but RBs his age rarely move and carry on the level they were pre-move.

Everyone’s gassed because Lamar will distract, etc.

I think he’ll simply be less productive than he was as “the guy”. 

I think that's what makes Henry seem overvalued at his ADP. Hard to predict touchdowns. Risky to bet on a crazy amount of TDs this year to prop up his value if he's not getting volume/yards between the 20s.

I doubt Henry gets 20+ touches every game. Baltimore needs him for the playoffs, they’re not gonna run their 30 year old RB up to 300+ touches.

I don't need 20+ touches. I just need a few goal line touches a game

Henry is also on one of the best offenses in football, doesn’t have a QB potentially throwing for 45 TDs in a season, and also he’s Derrick fucking Henry
Isn't he like 89 in running back dog years?
Yes but he’s like the dog from the sandlot (forget his name) that lived to like 26
I hesitate to vote against the King, he just keeps defying all odds and gets on the best offense of his career on a team that likes to run (ravens averaged a touchdown better per game)

I feel like people are ignoring that the Ravens O Line is not what it was last year and that Henry was showing significant decline already in his efficiency stats.
He’s still going to score enough TDs to be effective for fantasy, but I think we’re looking more at a 1000 yard 13 TD season than we are some top of the league projections people are making.

Didn’t Henry have the most yards after contact of anyone in the league despite being behind an o-line that gave him the fewest yards before contact?
I think his efficiency in Baltimore will be fine

I see him as a high floor guy and I’d love him in the second. Gus fuckin’ Edwards had 13 touchdowns with the Ravens last year, I think Henry can easily top that.
Yeah I think Henry is extremely safe and if the Ravens use him enough he has massive upside

Are we concerned about the Ravens o line after losing a lot of starters last year?

I mean he’s put up numbers with not great Titans teams and Baltimore has enough weapons so that opposing teams wont stack the box. Plus they way they used Edwards last year perfectly suits Henry’s upside so the positives outweigh the negatives imo.
