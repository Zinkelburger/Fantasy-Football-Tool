Zach Ertz (TE 35, ADP 271): After I mentioned Sinnott, I have to mention Ertz. Ertz is on this list for all the same reasons as Sinnott except he was the tight end the Kliff Kingsbury was using back in 2022. Of course Ertz is now 33 and has bounced around the league a bit since his knee injury but he is more likely to be the starter for the Commanders in week one. Not as high of a ceiling as other guys here, but I felt like I had to mention him.
