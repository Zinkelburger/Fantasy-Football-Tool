Glad you mentioned Jaylen Wright. Really high on him, as well, and hope he gets an opportunity. Miami did retool their offensive line a bit but still believe this will be a successful run team.

Heâ€™s so fast and they traded a 2025 3rd to draft him in the 2024 4th.

Upsides:
Elite Speed: Wright is one of the fastest running backs in his class, clocking a 4.38 40-yard dash. His breakaway speed makes him a big-play threat every time he touches the ball.
Explosive Playmaker: He had a 26% explosive rush rate in college, making him a dynamic option in space and a potential game-changer in the right offensive scheme.

Downsides:
Pass Protection Issues: Wright struggled with pass protection during his time at Tennessee, which could limit his usage on passing downs in the NFL. Given the Dolphins' offensive scheme, this could be a significant drawback.
Depth Chart Competition: Wright is entering a Miami backfield that includes Raheem Mostert, Jeff Wilson Jr., and rookie De'Von Achane. Mostert and Wilson are proven veterans, while Achane offers a similar speed threat with potentially better hands, making it difficult for Wright to carve out a significant role

Jaylen Wright: Mostert and Achane are not built for a heavy workload. If either gets injured then Wright will get touches. He fits the Dolphins' scheme to a tee. He's a handcuff with twice the chances to get touches.
