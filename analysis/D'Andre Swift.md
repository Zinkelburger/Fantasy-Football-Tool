"Swift has been a top-24 RB in PPR since entering the league.  The 25-year-old joins his third team in the Bears but joins what should be an explosive offense.  Even with an elite receiving veteran in Keenan Allen and one of the top rookie pass catchers in Odunze, a rookie quarterback like Caleb Williams may need some quick check-down passes, and Swift will be the benefactor of those.  Also, Swift should be a target for positive touchdown regression.  He has given plenty of alley-oops to Jamaal Williams in Detroit, and Jalen Hurts in Philly instead of getting in the end zone himself.  Between being a likely check-down target for a rookie QB in an explosive offense with projected positive TD regression, I have Swift remaining here."

"D’andre swift. The bears have been committed to running the ball for decades. And they are paying him handsomely. Roschon Johnson is the definition of a JAG, no idea why the industry hypes him so much."

Swift won’t be a bell cow. His body has proven incapable of handling such a role for a whole season. While he played 16 games last year, he only got 229 carriers. That’s as close to a bell cow as he’ll get.

Swift seems like one of the riskier ones. This big RB carousel makes me nervous for the lot of them. No wonder there are many RB-zero drafters among us this year.


I’m thinking Swift. An argument can be made his backfield mates are just as talented as he is.

Herbert has a higher yards per carry for his career and swift has played behind much better offensive lines than he has. Roschon has size and some versatility, paired with draft capital. Swift was a luxury signing for them since they had cap space, but I expect a full blown committee.
