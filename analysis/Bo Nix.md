Bo nix is looking like college form through preseason . Is this Sean Payton working some magic ? Is he the real deal can this hold up ? I have a good feeling about this man , Sutton & Mims Jr stock rising ? This man can air it out .

This is a good time to remind everyone that Kenny Pickett went 13-15 for 199 yards 2 tds and 0 ints last preseason.. You literally can‚Äôt extract anything meaningful out of his play so far.

Packers did not want to be there, 31 players sat out and the ones who played mailed it in on all three phases. We are talking running the same plays high-school level plays on offense and defense just to keep the clock moving. You should be taking less than nothing from this game either way.

Still reeling from investing heavily in Russ‚Äôs first Denver year across multiple teams. I‚Äôm out on Broncos Country until they show they can ride.

Bo Nix set the NCAA record for accuracy last year. He's my late round QB backup pick that may become my starter. People are sleeping on Sutton HARD

I have heard Nix is playing exceptional. I wish him the best in Denver

Bo Nix is difficult to justify. It's not like he has a stellar crew to work with, but he does have Payton as coach. It seems like he will be on the waivers the first couple of weeks so keep an eye on him and pick him up if the first week or two is promising.

I‚Äôm a üêªfan and I have thought Bo has looked good from the eye test. Besides the fact he has a cool ass Qb name, Payton hand picked him. Dude is good at utilizing a Qb he likes.

Oregon fan here: this is great for broncos RBs. Nix is not a risk taker and loves to check it down, and Payton loves to throw the ball to RBs. I really like Javonte and McLaughlin this year and will be taking a lot of late round swings at the Denver backfield
