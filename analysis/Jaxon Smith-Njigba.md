"Jaxon Smith-Njigba would be my guess. He seems to be going around pick 40 in standard and ppr leagues and much later in best ball from what I've seen of ADP and rankings. He feels like a huge value if he takes a year 2 jump and gets the slot role which was extremely productive for Ryan Grubb's offense at Washington the past 2 seasons."

"Not a bad guess, though he's going around WR40, not pick 40.

I like him a lot. Lockett's numbers, while still impressive, have been declining, though the key for JSN to really break out will be stealing some of those Lockett TDs."

"Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba remains one of the biggest questions marks heading into 2024. He was obviously the most talented wideout in the 2023 draft class but landed in a rough fantasy spot. Being stuck behind both DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett wasn't going to lead to many great fantasy days.

That is exactly what happened in 2023, as Smith-Njigba totaled 63 catches for 628 yards and four touchdowns. However, don't be surprised if the 22-year-old really takes off this season. With a new offensive coordinator in Seattle, the Seahawks could run more three-wide-receiver sets, which would benefit the young wideout. Trust his talent heading into Year 2."

Smith-Njigba is going to be an interesting player to watch in the new Seahawks offense. He has the skill set to win at every level of the field but has a limited ceiling while competing with both Metcalf and Tyler Lockett. He also has to navigate a new offense in year two and hopes that Geno Smith can improve over his 2023 results. JSN has a wide range of outcomes this year, but if Metcalf or Locket were to miss any time at all, Smith-Njigba has a chance to flirt with the top 15 wide receiver numbers. Add to that his WR4/5 price tag, and he is an easy selection in the ninth round.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba - In a new offence thatâ€™s much more focused on throwing the ball down field we could see what all the hype out of college was about. He was terribly utilized last season, and we saw Lockett begin to slip. If he takes over the WR2 role from Lockett and this Ryan Grubb offence is nearly as successful as it was in Washington, we could see a WR2 season from the sophomore going as WR45 right now.
