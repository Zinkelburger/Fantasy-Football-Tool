Keon Coleman has by far the highest ADP [of the Bills WRs] right now but do y’all expect him to live up to it? To me it seems like either Curtis Samuel or Khalil Shakir will return great value this year with their ADP at 120+. Both Diggs and Davis are gone, and the Bills have a top QB. None of their WR are being drafted very high so if anyone steps up at the WR1 it would be a huge win for managers.

"For a guy going around the mid 9th round with his size, and a QB like Allen He's absolutely worth the risk. At that spot it's all upside, low risk high reward."

"I like Coleman at his ADP and think he presents a great ceiling not typically found in the later rounds.

He is definitely a flawed prospect though, not a great route runner that struggles to create separation, weak analytic profile with a 1.9 YPRR, and doesn't have high end athletic traits."

"I particularly like Coleman's pairing with Josh Allen. Coleman would struggle to earn targets with more cautious QBs that need to see separation, but he fits perfectly with Josh Allen who is willing to Leroy Jenkins the ball deep no matter the coverage. The pairing reminds me a lot of the peak Stafford Kenny Golladay years."

"Josh asked Beane (Bills GM) for Keon, He's been lighting up training camp already. if Gabe Davis was fantasy viable ( true boom or bust guy) i think Keon is wayyyyy better than gabe, this kid got a great floor wit a high ceiling. 9th round adp is suitable."

Top 5 passing offenses historically produce top 12 Wr. One of these guys will end up atleast top 12. IMO it will be Keon, if anyone

3. This years Puka Nakua is Keon Coleman
(I swear I’m not a Rams fans but they just so happened to have the biggest value in recent memory). The key here, similar to the Chargers, the Bills have an elite passer who’s down his #1 WR. But unlike the rams with Kupp’s injury, the #1 WR spot for Buffalo is up for grabs all year. Shakir and Samuels are there but Keon is the big body and should dominate red zone. Trubisky was locked into Coleman at the goaline in their preseason game. I think Keon’s gonna flirt with 10 tds.
