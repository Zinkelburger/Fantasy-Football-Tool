"I project the Patriots are a bottom 5 offense this season with significantly less upside than the Panthers. Rookie QB, no elite talent on offense (i think Rhomandre is their best weapon but he's not elite) and one of the worst OL in the league. I will not be drafting anyone on this team remotely close to their ADP."

Rhamondre Stevenson [preseason] – Only played a couple of series and didn’t light up the stat sheet, but his motor was on display as he racked up most of his yards after contact. Beast.

Bad year last year, so going for good value. Post hype, but has a lot of upside.

I don’t think he has any upside but I have seen him go in the 7th and I’ll take that value. It seems like most people aren’t excited about him so he is becoming a value and I’ll take a boring RB2 in the 7th if I need that on draft day.
The Patriots starters could barely move the ball against the Eagles backups [in preseason].
