I’m gonna throw out Dyami Brown for the commanders. Good connection with Daniels so far, and we have nobody except Terry to throw to. Maybe boom/bust, but will always be available with the last pick

Dyami brown. He’s gonna be WR2 in WAS. Nothing great but if you’re looking for a flyer. Dotson not worth drafting

Agree he seems like the actual WR2. Probably will never be worth starting outside of Terry injury so not exactly a big swing but he’s worth noting

Could be a good dart throw in the final rounds
