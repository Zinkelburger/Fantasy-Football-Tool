Mims has not really played with the starters. I think Sutton, Patrick, and Reynolds will likely start.
Marvin Mims and Josh Reynolds are good receivers but Dulcich has shown the flashes in the past that he could beat them out. Dulcich has been killing it in camp and I expect his ADP to rise over the course of the month but he's my pick to break out this year.

Iâ€™m liking Mims Jr. in Denver, especially at his ADP. He was a solid pickup, seems to be doing well at camp and I think will be a solid #2 to Sutton

Denver's WR room is crowded with fairly decent options, but Mims is the only one that provides something unique among them (his speed vs the size of Sutton, Reynolds and Patrick). Could definitely seeing him being boom-or-bust.
