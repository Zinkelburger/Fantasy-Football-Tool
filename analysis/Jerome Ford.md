 As a Browns fan that was high on Ford last year, he just does not pass the eye test to me. His vision and burst are poor, and he needs the O like to make a gaping hole for him to get moving. Once he's off he's hard to catch, so the chance for big games is there. But I don't personally think he'll be anywhere near the bellcow people want with Chubb out. I expect to see more of a committee with the Foreman and possibly Hines 


 Jerome Ford was RB16 last year. If Chubb misses more time, can he repeat this year?

People put WAY too much stock into points generated from breakaway runs. One of the reasons people are so high on Moss but other than running through a gaping holes to the endzone on a few plays he didn't do much.

People are ignoring this but it says a lot about what the Browns think of Ford. Don't see Ford getting the goal line opportunities over Foreman.

This is why I have no interest in Jerome Ford, either. Even if Chubb doesn't come back 100% until week 12, I'd still be losing Ford for the most important part of the fantasy season.
