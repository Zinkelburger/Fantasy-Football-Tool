I’ve struggled to get a good qb over the years so I thought I’d pick him early last year. We all know how that turned out. Probably gonna pick him again though if he’s the best option for me.

Would be better off going for a lesser QB but without the major injury concerns, no? That's literally the biggest red flag criteria you should have?
