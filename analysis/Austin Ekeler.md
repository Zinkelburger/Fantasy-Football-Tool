"I'm starting to think Ekeler should be ranked higher, but that dude looked like he was running in slow motion"

Austin Ekeler. His efficiency shot down so quickly I have to believe it was injury related. Plus a new change of scenery in Washington, Ekeler is due to have a better season overall. 

Do people forget he had 7.3 yards per carry week 1 then high ankle sprain and when he returns everyone says he’s cooked… I’ve seen so many high ankle sprains derail a season… ekeler will surprise people

Well he was healthy enough to play week 17 when he ran for a whopping 1.1 yards per carry. He’s never rushed for more than 1000 yards in a season. All of his best fantasy seasons have come off the back of high TD, high reception campaigns both of which project to regress majorly in Washington. Daniels will check down less than Herbert and Robinson will steal much of the goaline work. Even ekeler has said he doesn’t want to be a workhorse back. He’ll need great efficiency to even be an RB2 and I don’t expect that to be the case from an aging back coming off a high ankle sprain as you mentioned.

People who didn't own Ekeler last year are misunderstanding how cooked he is. He is medium-well at best and I expect this season to be the broiler finish

I don’t see why you need to bet the farm based on his ADP. I’ve owned him the last couple years and he passes the eye test, has just been held back by a bad offense. I expect him to provide great value as a low end rb2 or better based on matchups. He’s their goal line back too, that’s gotta be worth something.


I’m out on Ekeler for several reasons:
    Daniels loves to run which will mean less check downs. Ekeler made all his fantasy success on receptions and touchdowns which leads me to my next point.
    Ekeler was at his best when the Chargers offence scored lots of touchdowns. I expect significantly less touchdowns in Washington than he ever had in LA.
    Brian Robinson will take some work, this is an issue he hasn’t had in LA the last few years because the RB depth chart was ass.
    He looked extremely slow last year running the ball. He’s an aging running back and we know the fall off comes fast and hard for those boys.

 Being super-honest, looking at RBs 29 and older, 5'9" and shorter, since 2000, and I am not overwhelmed by the comparisons. Priest Holmes had much less tread on his tires before hitting 29, and was on a great offense. (Also note that only two of these seasons were in the past 5 years)

From RB1 overall to a low end RB2 instantly... I'm not buying that he fell that hard that fast without some undisclosed injuries he was playing through for contract purposes. I don't think he can be an RB1 in a Commanders uniform regardless, but his ADP is great for a flier.
