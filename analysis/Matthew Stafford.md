Hamstring injuries for pocket passers aren’t a big deal right? I draft in 5 minutes 

Rams’ Matthew Stafford: Injures hamstring Wednesday 

one thing to note - despite his superbowl win. I still think he's one of the most underrated QBs ever. he brings the best out of his WR's. Every single one of them. Even on the lions. Kenny Golladay was never that good, Stafford just gave him perfect ball placement

Dude literally ran a two minute drill to win a game with a dislocated shoulder and a probable concussion. One of the best 4th quarter QB's of all time.
