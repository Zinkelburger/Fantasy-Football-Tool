"Was on pace for a career year last season before his injury and Ridely and Zay Jones are gone. Think he will be a monster in PPR leagues."
"He and Engram have guaranteed targets this year. I totally agree."
"Christian Kirk. He's rarely viewed as the alpha in his offense, but he just contributes. There's always a sexy new piece in his offense. Even when people talk about him, his ADP has a ceiling because of the other trendy names that come up every year."

"Christian Kirk - High floor, low-ish ceiling play for a guy that is a safety valve and WR1 for TLaw."

"I think the issue with Kirk is ceiling. He is basically never really going to go over WR20ish. Don't get me wrong, at his ADP, that's great. But there really isn't a break out chance. He is who he is.

So if you got some high upside guys, he is fine as like a anchor to that kind of roster. Otherwise, I'd rather take my shots elsewhere."

"Christian Kirk. WR30 is too low imo. TLaw seems to like him, and with Jones and Ridley gone there’s way less target competition for Kirk this year. He was a bit inconsistent last season but was pacing to beat WR30 last year until he missed some time. With likely more targets, no reason he can’t exceed this ADP barring injury."
