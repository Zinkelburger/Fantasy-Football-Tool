He dummy thicc and move in slow motion

Worth stashing because RB's are hard to come by. What's wrong with him is he isn't very good

“Any time you can have Josh Jacobs and AJ Dillon, that’s a pretty good 1-2 combination right there, so I’m excited to see those guys this year.” — #Packers OC Adam Stenavich 

Great point. Dillon isn't even draftable. Lloyd has great value at his ADP.

Dillon is just slow and not useful except maybe as a blocker.

God damn AJ Dillon must be helluva teammate because he sucks as an NFL RB.

Not only a great teammate as he's helped Jacob's and Lloyd get acclimated, but my gosh he's just the absolute best guy to have in GB. He loves it here, loves the fans, is humble and kind, just an all around great guy.

I don't think I've ever rooted harder for a below average guy lol.

AJ Dillon had 7 carries inside the 5 last year; he scored one (1) TD on those attempts. Of all 27 RBs that took at least 40% of their team’s carries inside the 5 (Dillon had 41.2%), his conversion rate ranked 26th, ahead of only Alexander Mattison. Turns out he sucked at that too, go figure

AJ Dillon is one of the worst short yardage backs in the league 

AJ Dillon still looks like shit, Jacobs should be the clear cut RB1
