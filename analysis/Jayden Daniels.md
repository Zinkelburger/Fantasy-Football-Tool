"Jayden Daniels going full RG3 and staying healthy is probably the last guy on the list who it's conceivable could do it. Washington always down, 500-800 yard rush ability... again, it's a longshot, but it's not impossible."

"Completely understand being out on Daniels given the risks of being a rookie behind a terrible OL"

"Jayden Daniels - Say hello to this year's big QB sleeper. I love the bet on a top 5 season for him over Caleb (who I like too)."

"I can't say Jayden has the passing upside for QB1, but he's surrounded by pretty solid talent at his skill positions. While he didn't have the raw numbers that Lamar Jackson had in college, he did have better efficiency and was still able to get into the endzone for double digit TDs his last 2 seasons."

"The way I kind of view it is Daniels is more like Lamar in the sense that he was always a threat to pull it down and run. He has the skills to go for big yardage and itâ€™s a large part of his game. So Daniels big upside"

Preseason: good footwork, precise throws. Strange runs. He gets hit hard. You never see Lamar Jackson get hit hard like this. Didn't fall well. Very good anticipation, decisiveness. He takes a lot of hits, instead of sliding or getting out of bounds. Lot of short throws, high completion percentage.
