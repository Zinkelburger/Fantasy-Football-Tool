"A.J. Brown - Arguably the most physically talented WR in the league behind Tyreek Hill. Philly's offense could play faster and higher pass rate under Kellen Moore, rebounding after a horrible finish behind Hurts' playmaking."

Upside:

    Consistent Performance: Brown has consistently ranked as a top-six fantasy wide receiver in his two seasons with the Eagles, with career highs in targets (158) and catches (106) last year​ (Draft Sharks)​.
    Improved Offensive Scheme: Kellen Moore's offensive approach is anticipated to increase passing volume and efficiency, potentially boosting Brown's production. The Eagles' offense will likely see more pre-snap motion and formation diversity, which can create more opportunities for Brown​ (Fantasy Football Calculator)​​ (Draft Sharks)​.
    Volume and Reliability: Brown has been durable, playing all 17 regular-season games in the last two seasons. His high target share (31.1% last season) ensures a solid volume of opportunities​ (Draft Sharks)​.

Drawbacks/Considerations:

    Inconsistency: Brown's performance dipped in the latter half of the 2023 season, dropping from an average of 22.6 PPG in the first nine weeks to 10.8 PPG thereafter. This inconsistency raises some concerns​ (Fantasy Football Calculator)​.
    TD Dependency: Despite his high yardage, Brown's touchdown count was moderate, partly due to Jalen Hurts' rushing tendencies and the Eagles' low pass rate inside the 10-yard line​ (Draft Sharks)​.
    New Offensive Dynamics: While Moore's arrival is generally positive, adjusting to a new offensive system can introduce some uncertainties early in the season​ (Fantasy Football Calculator)​​ (Draft Sharks)​
