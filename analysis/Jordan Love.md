"Jordan Love - Could be MVP and I'm trusting Lafleur to cook."

I'm taking Love - 32 passing TDs with a rocky start to the season isn't to be sniffed at. Better QB rating and yards

Threw at least one TD in all but one game, and for over 250 yards in all but three as well (one of those three games was also the zero TD game). As one might suspect, all three of those games came during Weeks 1-7.

From Week 8 on, he only threw four interceptions versus 22 touchdowns.

Iâ€™m not sure people truly appreciate how good Love was for the back half of the season. But Love can also take a step forward with an improved receiving core that might all be healthy at the same time for once.
