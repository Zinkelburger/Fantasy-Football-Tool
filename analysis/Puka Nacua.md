"Puka Nacua was the best rookie WR. For the past 4 years the best rookie WR has at least held their value

2019 A.J. Brown
2020 Justin Jefferson
2021 Ja'Marr Chase
2022 Garrett Wilson

you could say Wilson was disappointing, but he's still being drafted extremely high. call me crazy, but it seems like a strong rookie season is a pretty good predictor of future success"

"I think this is the blueprint for how they continue their success in 2024. Puka is the shot in the arm the offense needs to move the ball consistently. So many times they tried to go to Kupp and he just looks a step off from normal."

"I would not take Puka at the late first/early second tbh. I know he is the sub’s darling, but I would have trouble trusting him to be as consistent as he was last year and return good value now that Kupp is back"

Upside

Puka Nacua emerged as a breakout star in his rookie season, setting NFL rookie records with 105 receptions for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns. He finished as the WR4 in PPR formats, averaging 17.6 fantasy points per game, showcasing his ability to produce consistently even with Cooper Kupp in the lineup​ (FantasyPros)​​ (Pro Football Network)​. Entering 2024, Nacua remains a central figure in the Rams' passing game, benefiting from the continuity of playing with Matthew Stafford and under the same offensive system led by Sean McVay and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur​ (Draft Sharks)​. His high target share (28.7%) and excellent yards per route run (2.59) underscore his efficiency and reliability​ (Draft Sharks)​.

While Nacua's rookie season was historic, there are a few considerations for 2024. Cooper Kupp's return to health could impact Nacua's target volume. When Kupp played, Nacua's production slightly dipped, although it remained strong (averaging 16.9 PPR points per game with Kupp compared to 22.8 without)​ (Draft Sharks)​. Additionally, Nacua's athletic profile is somewhat underwhelming, as he lacks top-tier speed and agility, which raises questions about his ceiling as a long-term elite WR​ (Pro Football Network)​.I'm not sold he's a top 5 wr in the game. Is he good, sure. But with a truly healthy Kupp back, not the version we got when he played last year, hell be a bit more involved. I think the drafting of corum also means they can continue to run the ball more effectively.

Remember, they're not saying they won't draft him at all. Just hard to justify at his current ADP 

 Puka Nacua is a very exciting player but at this moment he’s being drafted at his ceiling and with Kupp healthy and Stafford having age / injury concerns. I also believe his floor may be lower than presumed without a history of sustained production. Should Stafford have a healthy season and Kupp were to slow down at all then Puka is likely in for an awesome season, his ceiling never dropped with Kupp in the lineup and his touchdown regression could make up for the loss in the targets.

However, Puka was far more volatile when Kupp played and his best performances afterwards relied on touchdowns over volume with the exception of week 16. I wouldn’t pass on him if he were to fall a little but at his current ADP I believe you can find equally high floors and ceilings.
