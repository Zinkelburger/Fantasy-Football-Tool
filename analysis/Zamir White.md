"I think he's going to be good for where he's going. He got 4 starts last year which isn't a great sample set, but he averaged, 99 rushing yds, 4.7 YPC, and 20 receiving yds a game which had him at 14.1 PPG in half ppr which would have been a very solid RB2. The concern is that he only had 1 TD in those 4 games, and if the Raiders offence isn't getting many scoring opportunities then his ceiling will be very capped. But the team is essentially the same as the end of year last year, and it seems like his coach likes him, and his only competition at RB is Mattison who they brought over on a pretty low contract. I don't think he will get to a top 10 RB like White, but I think he will be a solid RB2 with limited upside weeks, and he's going in the right range of the draft. If you went heavy WR in your draft, I think he would be a good add where he's at."

"Alexander Mattison production with Mike Davis quads. LA face with an Oakland booty"

"Neither, Rachaad White was used as a pass catcher often. Then Mattison was just awful. I think Zamir White will be a serviceable RB2/Flex but he’s on a bad team and isn’t expected to contribute much in the passing game. He’ll def get the volume and should be solid on goal line touches, but not catching passes while being on a shitty team that’s likely to play from behind a lot def limits his upside.

So as far as total fantasy points, I see him somewhere between Rachaad and Mattison. I know a lot of ppl are super high on him, I just don’t see the massive fantasy production that many are expecting. I think he’ll be good enough to be a weekly RB2/Flex at best."

"Zamir White's floor is last year's Alexander Mattison. He's definitely not being drafted at his floor, people are expecting mid-tier RB2 numbers."

"This sub is fawning over Zamir. He does absolutely nothing well, he’s just going to get volume in a bottom 5 offense. Mattison was in the same role in a better offense and was a huge bust. I will have 0 white across any league and have less than 3% in bestball. I am willing to get beat if it’s by the hands of White."

"I think zamir is a lock for 15+ carries a game"

The raiders are one of the few teams that have proven they run of one premier lead back/bellcow which is a plus and i do think the raiders offense improves quite a bit with the mullet under center. 

Whether he turns out to be a breakout or another RB dead zone casualty, we will all say "of course that happened, look at the signs!" after the fact, despite everyone just guessing right now.

A non-pass catching RB on one of the worst offenses in the league.
He’s the quintessential dead zone RB.

BUT, on a team that wants to ground and pound, and a team that played excellent defense down the stretch last year (and added Christian Wilkins). They might be able to keep game scripts in White's favor more times than not.

Skeptical of the talent but like the situation. His ADP is mid 5th round or so and I think I'd rather have Rhamondre, Najee, or Mostert in that range.

Floor play at his adp. Not a great receiver, but might be a solid rb in low scoring defensive drain the clock games.

This year's Miles Sanders is Zamir White. Value propped up by expected volume, but the offense will be bad and he's not talented enough to make up for that.
I think an apt comparison for White is last year's Alexander Mattison. A holdover who has looked ok, with the only real argument for drafting him, is that they have no one else.
