"This might sound a little crazy but a little concerned St. Brown won't be able to return first round value. He had 10 td's last season despite being 40 something in red zone targets, don't see that changing much with how much they run in the red zone and LaPorta being a preferred red zpne option. The longer td's he got seem like they could hit or miss."

Upside:

    Consistency: St. Brown had 11 games with at least 18 fantasy points last season, making him one of the most consistent wide receivers in fantasy football​ (Fantasy Nerds)​.
    High Volume: He boasts a high target share and reception count, proving his reliability in the Lions' offense.
    Offensive Stability: The continuity in the Lions' offensive scheme under Dan Campbell and the developing talent around him, including QB Jared Goff and rookie RB Jahmyr Gibbs, further boost his upside​ (Pro Football Network)​​ (FantasyPros)​.

Drawbacks/Things to Keep in Mind:

Injury Risk: While currently considered low, any potential injuries to key offensive players could impact his production.
Depth of Target: St. Brown isn't typically a deep threat, with his average depth of target being relatively low, which might limit his big-play potential compared to other elite WRs​ (Pro Football Network)​.

"Sun God for risk adverse

Chase for me

JJ for ceiling"

"ARSB is probably the safest pick but I love the upside of Chase."

"Amon-Ra for sure. Especially after that Receiver special on Netflix. He’s a reception machine because of his ability to get open, and the fact that he has that offensive wizard Ben Johnson calling plays helps a lot."

I have the 1.04 and I am very carefully considering him. He has such a stable floor throughout the whole season that it just makes so much sense.

Man I’m really really hoping I get ARSB with my pick. I feel like every other receiver in the top 10 has a huge asterisk.

Lambs contract shit is starting to get worrying

Hills hand is in a brace

JJ has Darnold throwing to him and might be doubled every play if Addison misses time

Chase is apparently nursing an injury and holding out for a contract… that he has two years left on… while Higgins is on the tag…

Pittman is on a questionable offense with an injury prone QB.

And then there’s good ole ARSB who just feels like such a safe pick, but people are gonna look at me funny if I take him over Reek or Lamb.

Bro got paid and so did his qb I feel like this the year for him

Amon-Ra St. Brown feels like a less safe pick than those who come before his average draft position (ADP). The Lions ran nuclear fission hot in 2023 and their offense looks well set for the long term.

But if Jahmyr Gibbs and Sam LaPorta make second-year leaps, which is not uncommon, and Jameson Williams finally has a clean offseason, then it could eat a bit into Brown’s volume.
