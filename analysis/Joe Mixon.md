 And now he is older, on a new team, with a young QB and 3 good-elite pass catching options, currently missing practice, and no assurance he gets anywhere near the volume he has had historically.

 Mixon has only had >4.10YPC twice in his career, but has benefited greatly from dump offs. He’s a been a very consistent player, seldom hurt, and counting stats are usually good even if volatile. In 2022, he was only top-12 on a weekly basis 6 times, and his year end was inflated by his demolishing of Carolina 4-211-5 for 55pts (I lost with him in my lineup that week separate note lol).

The issue is where the original comment suggested to draft him. There are like 20 RBs I would rather take ahead of Mixon and who knows how many WRs. No need to reach at the start of RD2 in most any format or draft. His PPR ADP on FantasyPros is currently 38th overall, RB15, so he’s a 4th round pick. You’d probably be better to take other higher end guys and trade them for Mixon+ after the draft if he didn’t survive to your RD3/4 turn selections. 

"The Bengals and Joe Mixon parted ways with each other this past offseason.  When Mixon was healthy, he was always a relevant fantasy back then.  Now he enters an offense that is up and coming in Houston behind what should be an upgraded offensive line.  I don't consider Dameon Pierce a threat in the Texan's backfield, and Mixon should expect a vast load of carries.  He is a solid veteran who should be on the back end of being effective, but he probably has at least this year in him. "

"Joe Mixon in like round 4-5. Just saw a headline that said Houston plans to use him in a workhorse roll. I want every piece of the Texans offense."

"I agree. Joe Mixon has looked like he's running through wet concrete for 2 years and somehow still manages solid fantasy production. RB is weird"

Joe Mixon (This offense could pop off, and he could be a massive benefactor of that)

Joe Mixon is the guy for me. He hasn’t been the most efficient back over the past few years and Texans Oline isn’t the greatest at run blocking. If someone drafts him to be their lead back they will be very disappointed.
