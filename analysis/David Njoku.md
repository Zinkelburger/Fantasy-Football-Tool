"Been snatching Njoku in round 6 or 7 in best ball drafts. I feel like thereâ€™s a big drop off after him."

"Big Njoku fan too but Watson doesn't look his way nearly as much as Flacco did down the stretch."

"I knew David Njoku had a good season last year, but I didn't realize he had 123 targets. It is worth noting that he had roughly 8 targets per game with QB's other than Watson, and 5 targets per game with Watson. I would not expect a repeat of his 2023 performance, but wouldn't have a problem viewing him as TE 10-12."
