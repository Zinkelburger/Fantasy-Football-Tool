"James Cook - I have him behind Jacobs due to questions about the goal-line role but he has shown to be a crucial playmaker on the ground and in the air for a Bills team that needs playmakers and should be winning games."

James Cook (He could be a top 10 RB with the vacated targets/production under Brady as OC)

James Cook hella underrated NFL RB 

I think he's gonna catch a lot more passes than most people expect.  The goal-line vulturing could get super annoying tho! 

Cook won’t score many TDs but he might crush it in PPR though. He’s being under drafted this year IMO.

I don’t why I’m seeing so many people down on Cook. He went from 15 touches per game to 20 touches per game when Joe Brady came in last year. Thats a massive jump. Hes also now likely the focal point of the offense.

The only argument I’ve seen against Cook is “lack of TDs”, but let’s remember Cook was a top 12 RB last year despite only having 2 rushing TDs. He doesn’t need to score many to easily return value.
