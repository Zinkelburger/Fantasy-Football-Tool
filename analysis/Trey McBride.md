Taking McBride. I think the cardinals offense could be decent this year.

As an honorable mention im going to put Trey McBride up here as well. McBride fits our mold as a player (#2 option and at only 24 years old) but his teams offensive output does not. Vegas has Arizona predicted to be the 19th best offense this year which obviously doesn't fit our mold. However its safe to say there are a lot of unknowns involving the Cardinals. Is Kyler going to stay healthy? How good is Marvin Harrison Jr? Vegas doesn't like dealing with unknowns and that's why they push middle of the pack lines on a lot of these question mark teams. Every year a team exceeds expectations just like the Texans did last year and im expecting the Cardinals (at least from a fantasy perspective) to be a lot better than Vegas is predicting. I'm not going to break the mold to include McBride but he's a solid honorable mention especially if you believe the Cardinals will be a better offense than Vegas is predicting. 

I really like getting the McBride Kyler stack at the cost in mocks so far. I donâ€™t love the RBs, QBs, or WRs going around Mcbrides ADP so it feels good grabbing him with some TE1 upside
