"Dak has like four rushing scores in the last three years. Since the ankle snapped he’s never been quite the same. He was never fast and now he’s slow as a molasses drip, I’m a Cowboys lifer and watch every snap."

" QB: Dak Prescott (QB9) feels like a no-brainer to wait for over people reaching for Stroud. I get there is trepidation about how little the Cowboys added to their offensive playmakers, but Lamb and Ferguson remain as the two top targets and Brandin Cooks is a reliable third option. "

"Dude passes the ball a lot and despite the INTs he gets a lot of TDs throughout the season."
